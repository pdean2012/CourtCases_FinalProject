should be allowed.  Per McLachlin C.J.
and Bastarache, Binnie, Deschamps, Fish, Abella and Charron JJ.:  The
trial judgment dismissing the action should be restored.  M’s expression of
opinion, however exaggerated, was protected by the law.  M’s editorial was
defamatory, but the trial judge was correct to allow the defence of fair
comment.  [4] [56] [64-65]  Although this is a private law case that is not
governed directly by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , the
evolution of the common law is to be informed and guided by Charter  values. 
The law of fair comment must therefore be developed in a manner consistent not
only with the values underlying freedom of expression, including freedom of the
media, but also with those underlying the worth and dignity of each individual,
including reputation.  A court’s task is not to prefer one set of values over
the other, but rather to attempt a reconciliation. [2]   It is therefore appropriate to modify the “honest
belief” element of the fair comment defence so that the test, as modified,
consists of the following elements:  (a) the comment must be on a matter of
public interest; (b) the comment must be based on fact; (c) the comment, though
it can include inferences of fact, must be recognizable as comment; (d) the
comment must satisfy the following objective test: could any person honestly
express that opinion on the proved facts?  Even though the comment satisfies
the objective test of honest belief, the defence can be defeated if the
plaintiff proves that the defendant was subjectively actuated by express
malice.  The defendant must prove the four elements of the defence before the
onus switches back to the plaintiff to establish malice. [28] [52]     If the defendant is successful in establishing the
elements of the fair comment defence, the inquiry may turn to malice, which the
plaintiff must prove if alleged.  Proof of malice may be drawn from the
language of the assertion itself or from the circumstances surrounding the
publication of the comment.  It may involve inferences and evidentiary
presumptions.  In order to defeat fair comment, malice  must be the dominant
motive for expressing an opinion.  There was no evidence of malice on the facts
of this case. [100] [106-107]   Cases Cited  By Binnie J.   By LeBel J.  Referred to:  Sim v.

Binnie J. — This
appeal requires the Court to reexamine the defence of fair comment which helps
hold the balance in the law of defamation between two fundamental values,
namely the respect for individuals and protection of their reputation from
unjustified harm on the one hand, and on the other hand, the freedom of
expression and debate that is said to be the “very life blood of our freedom
and free institutions”: Price v. Chicoutimi Pulp Co. (1915), 51 S.C.R.
179, at p. 194.  Under the present law, if a plaintiff shows the defendant
published something harmful to his or her reputation, then both falsity and
damage are presumed, and the onus shifts to the defendants to establish an
applicable defence, including the defence of fair comment.  In Cherneskey
v. Armadale Publishers Ltd., [1979] 1 S.C.R. 1067, Dickson J., in
dissent, identified the elements of the “fair comment” defence as follows:  (a)   the comment must be on a matter of public
interest;  (b)   the comment must be based on fact;  (c)   the comment, though it can include
inferences of fact, must be recognisable as comment;  (d)   the comment must satisfy the following
objective test: could any man honestly express that opinion on the proved
facts?  (e)   even though the comment satisfies the objective
test the defence can be defeated if the plaintiff proves that the defendant was
actuated by express malice. [Emphasis in original deleted; pp. 1099-1100.]  (citing Duncan and Neill on Defamation (1978), at p. 62)  Although on
that occasion a majority of the Court insisted on framing the honest belief
requirement in subjective terms (the comment must express an opinion honestly
held by the speaker), I believe experience has shown that Dickson J.’s
“objective” formulation of the “honest belief” test better conforms to the
requirements of free expression endorsed as a fundamental value of our society
by s. 2 (b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  Of
course, even if the elements of the “fair comment” defence are established, the
plaintiff can still succeed by proving that the defendant was actuated by
malice, i.e. for an indirect or improper motive not connected with the purpose
for which the defence exists (Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada v. Dalrymple,
[1965] S.C.R. 302, at p. 309).  [2]    
This is a private law case that is not governed directly by the Charter . 
Yet it was common ground in the argument before us that the evolution of the
common law is to be informed and guided by Charter  values.  Particular
emphasis was placed on the importance of ensuring that the law of fair comment
is developed in a manner consistent with the values underlying freedom of
expression.  However, the worth and dignity of each individual, including
reputation, is an important value underlying the Charter  and is to be
weighed in the balance with freedom of expression, including freedom of the
media.  The Court’s task is not to prefer one over the other by ordering a
“hierarchy” of rights (Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., [1994] 3
S.C.R. 835), but to attempt a reconciliation.  An individual’s reputation is
not to be treated as regrettable but unavoidable road kill on the highway of
public controversy, but nor should an overly solicitous regard for personal
reputation be permitted to “chill” freewheeling debate on matters of public
interest.  As it was put by counsel for the intervener Media Coalition, “No one
will really notice if some [media] are silenced; others speaking on safer and
more mundane subjects will fill the gap” (Factum, at  para. 14).  [3]    
The issue of balance is raised here in the context of a “shock
jock” radio talk show hosted by the appellant Rafe Mair, a well-known and
sometimes controversial commentator on matters of public interest in British
Columbia.  The target of his “editorial” on October 25, 1999 was the respondent
Kari Simpson, a widely known social activist.  The context was public debate
over the introduction of materials dealing with homosexuality into public
schools.  Mair and Simpson took opposing sides in the debate about whether the
purpose of this initiative was to teach tolerance of homosexuality or to
promote a homosexual lifestyle.  Simpson was a leading public figure in the
debate, and the trial judge found that she had a public reputation as a leader
of those opposed to any positive portrayal of a gay lifestyle.  The nub of
Simpson’s complaint is the following portion of the Rafe Mair editorial
broadcast on October 25, 1999:  Before Kari was on my colleague Bill Good’s show last Friday I listened
to the tape of the parents’ meeting the night before where Kari harangued the
crowd.  It took me back to my childhood when with my parents we would listen to
bigots who with increasing shrillness would harangue the crowds. For Kari’s
homosexual one could easily substitute Jew.  I could see Governor Wallace — in
my mind’s eye I could see Governor Wallace of Alabama standing on the steps of
a schoolhouse shouting to the crowds that no Negroes would get into Alabama
schools as long as he was governor.  It could have been blacks last Thursday
night just as easily as gays.  Now I’m not suggesting that Kari was proposing
or supporting any kind of holocaust or violence but neither really — in the
speeches, when you think about it and look back — neither did Hitler or
Governor Wallace or [Orval Faubus] or Ross Barnett.  They were simply declaring
their hostility to a minority.  Let the mob do as they wished.  (The full text of the editorial is attached in the Appendix.)  [4]    
The courts in British Columbia were divided on the legal
outcome.  The trial judge dismissed the action on the basis that, while
statements complained of in the editorial (in particular the imputation that
Simpson “would condone violence toward gay people”) were defamatory,
nevertheless, the defence of fair comment applied and provided a complete
defence ((2004), 31 B.C.L.R. (4th) 285, 2004 BCSC 754, at para. 6).  The Court
of Appeal reversed ((2006), 55 B.C.L.R. (4th) 30, 2006 BCCA 287).  In its view,
the defence of fair comment was not available because there was no evidentiary
foundation for the imputation that Simpson would condone violence; nor had Mair
testified that he had an honest belief that Simpson would condone violence.  In
my view, with respect, the Court of Appeal unduly favoured protection of Kari
Simpson’s reputation in a rancourous public debate in which she had involved
herself as a major protagonist.  The factual basis of the editorial was
Simpson’s speech.  Mair stated in the editorial that he had listened “to the
tape of the parents’ meeting the night before where Kari harangued the crowd”. 
Simpson had been making speeches in a similar vein for some time.  Whatever
view one may take of Mair’s commentary, the factual basis of the controversy
was indicated in the editorial and widely known to his listeners.  In the
absence of demonstrated malice on his part (which the trial judge concluded was
not a dominant motive), his expression of opinion, however exaggerated, was
protected by the law.  We live in a free country where people have as much
right to express outrageous and ridiculous opinions as moderate ones.  I would
therefore allow the appeal.  I.      Facts  [5]    
Rafe Mair’s radio talk show is carried on station CKNW owned and
operated by the appellant WIC Radio Ltd., which accepts legal responsibility
for the broadcast.  Mair has a reputation for provoking controversy.  With
controversy has come a measure of commercial success.  His listeners expect to
hear extravagant opinions and, according to his counsel, discount them
accordingly.  [6]    
The trial judge found that Kari Simpson was a social activist
with “a public reputation as a leader of those opposed to schools teaching
acceptance of a gay lifestyle” (para. 10).  Simpson had earlier opposed three
books placed in Surrey schools which portrayed family units with same-sex
parents.  She helped write and promote a Declaration of Family Rights
which asserted that children should not be exposed to any teaching which
“portrays the lifestyle of gays . . . as one which is normal, acceptable or
must be tolerated” (A.R., at p. 387).  The document included a form to be sent
by parents to their children’s schools as follows:  .
. .  NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN:  . . . that [child’s name, date of birth] . . . must not by any teacher
or, through the teacher, any other persons or resource materials, or the
learning environment, be exposed to and/or involved in any activity or program
which:  1.  Discusses or portrays the lifestyle of gays, lesbians, bisexual
and/or transgendered individuals as one which is normal, acceptable or must be
tolerated; . . .  (Declaration of Family Rights (A.R., at p. 387))  It seems that
Kari Simpson relished her role as a public figure.  At one point Simpson faxed
Mair a cover article about herself in British Columbia Report magazine
entitled “The Most Dangerous Woman in B.C.” (November 24, 1997).  [7]    
The trial judge found that Kari Simpson’s reputation was earned
as a result of her “very public actions and words” (para. 10).  Further, “[h]er
reputation was fairly characterized by Mair at trial as the person who was
associated by the media with the anti-gay side” (para. 11).  This
characterization is supported by various of Kari Simpson’s speeches put in
evidence at the trial, including the following extracts:  There is another group within the homosexual
community though who is very much politically driven. These people want your
children. . . . [W]hen homosexuality takes on all the aspects of a political
movement it too becomes a war. . . . And the spoils turn out to be our
children. An exaggeration? Well, what are we to think when militant homosexuals
seek to lower the age of consensual sexual intercourse between homosexual men
and young boys to the age of 14.  (Speech at Fort St. John (April 3, 1997), at p. 17; A.R., at p. 510)  The theme of
confrontation recurs in many of Simpson’s speeches made exhibits at trial:  I talk about that because this is a war. It’s not
going to go away that easy. And usually the first casualty of war is truth, the
second casualty is our children. How many here will put their hands up today
and say, “I will not let the second casualty be my children.”                                                                              .
. .  It is a war. Quite often people when they first go
out they say, “Oh, Kari, somebody said something mean to me,” and I go “uh,
uh.” I said, “War, you shoot, they shoot.” Your aim is better. It’s really not
complicated.  (Speech at Prince George (May 1997), at pp. 17 and 66; A.R., at pp. 595
and 644)  Kari Simpson
expressed the view that “tolerance” was driven by “political correctness”:  Is homosexuality normal?  No.  Does that mean that people shouldn’t
indulge in it?  Quite frankly, that’s their right. . . . But it’s not normal. 
It’s a little bit like saying smoking is healthy, you know.  Is homosexuality acceptable?  In my household, no,
absolutely not.  It’s destructive.  .
. .  The one that really got people was when we knew and
we deliberately put [into the Declaration of Family Rights] “must be
tolerated”, because, you see, we’re conditioned in this politically correct
insanity to believe that we have to tolerate everything, that we’re not
permitted to discriminate.  Well, I think that those words need to be
rehabilitated just a little bit.  .
. .  Is it up to the state to dictate to me or my
children what we must tolerate?  I don’t think so.  Quite frankly, I’m tired of
it.                                                                              .
. .  So I really encourage you please, we need your
help. War is not cheap, people, and we’re in a war. We’re in a war for the
identity of this nation, for the identity of our children, for their future.  (Speech at Salmon Arm (May 18, 1999), at pp. 41-43 and 72; A.R., at pp.
691-93 and 722)  [8]    
The trial judge also emphasized that Simpson championed her views
through democratic means, not violence.  She encouraged sympathetic members of
her audience to exercise influence through pressure on politicians at all
levels.  She urged her listeners “to vote, to write, and to speak out about
their values and views” (para. 15).  “As people as voters and tax payers you
have enormous power.  Do not underestimate the value of a phone call” (A.R., at
p. 535).  “Our mandate [Citizens Research Institute] is to ensure that the
electorate is informed and participating in an informed way in the politics of
the province” (A.R., at p. 652).  Typical of her speeches is the following
exhortation:  Your phone can do marvelous things back east where they need to be
woken up.  They think they’re so politically savvy back there, but they really
haven’t got the sport down pat yet.  Yes, out here in British Columbia it is a
sport.  That’s why they want to take our guns away.  We know how to shoot.  (Speech at Prince George (May 1997), at pp. 68-69; A.R., at pp. 646-47)  [9]    
Simpson claimed that certain words in the October 25 broadcast
were defamatory in their ordinary and natural meaning.  Simpson alleged, as
well, that the following defamatory innuendos were conveyed by words in the
broadcast: (a) that she had advocated or was in favour of parents taking their
children out of school because the children’s teacher was gay; (b) that she
advocated keeping gay people out of Surrey’s public schools; (c) that she
was hostile toward gay people to the point that she would condone violence
toward gay people; (d) that she preaches hatred against gay people; (e)
that she rants against gay people in a way that would influence someone to take
the law into his own hands and do them harm; (f) that she would employ tactics
against gay people similar to those used by Hitler and other bigots, such as
former State Governor George Wallace, Governor Ross Barnett and Governor Orval
Faubus; and (g) that she is a dangerous bigot apt to cause harm to gay
people.   At trial, Mair testified that no such imputations of violence were
intended by him nor in fact made.  He said:  I didn’t say that Kari is — is a violent person or would want violence
to happen.  I don’t think that — I think that would be the furthest thing from
her mind.  I think she’s, in her own mind, at least, a gentle person.  I’m not
talking really about what Kari is.  I’m talking about what the consequences of
thinking that you’re doing the right thing this way under these circumstances
may well be. [A.R., at p. 340]  II.    Judicial
History  A.   British Columbia Supreme Court (Koenigsberg
J.) ((2004), 31 B.C.L.R. (4th) 285, 2004 BCSC 754)  [10]
The trial judge noted Mair’s comparisons of Simpson in her public
persona to Hitler, Wallace, Faubus, Barnett, the KKK and skinheads.  The
meaning to be ascribed to these comparisons is that Simpson “would condone
violence” (para. 6); this imputation was found to be defamatory.  Further, the
following words, having regard to the comparisons, were also found to be
defamatory:  Kari Simpson is, thank God, permitted in our free society to say what
she wishes.  But the other side of the free speech coin is a public decent enough
to know a mean-spirited, power mad, rabble rousing and yes, dangerous bigot,
when they see one. [para. 31]  [11]
As to the defence of fair comment, the trial judge found that the
facts stated in the editorial were true (para. 44).  Kari Simpson had spoken on
Bill Good’s show, and at a rally the night before.  On both occasions she was
“on message”.  Other facts of the controversy were well known at the time
though unstated in the editorial (e.g. that Simpson was an active promoter of
the Declaration of Family Rights (para. 52)).  The trial judge
concluded:  [T]he defence has established that every element of the factual
foundation was either stated or publicly known; that Mair was aware of them
all; and that they were all substantially true in the sense that they were true
in so far as they go to the pith and substance of the opinion Mair expressed.
[para. 61]  [12]
The trial judge found that the editorial was directed to a matter
of public interest.  The issues underlying the broadcast such as tolerance,
discrimination, and the place for discussion of homosexuality in public
schools, were matters of widespread controversy.  The trial judge found (at
paras. 64-66) that there was no basis upon which to challenge that Mair
honestly believed what he said.  There was some evidence of intrinsic malice:  There is no question, in my view, that the
language, tone of voice and characterizations utilized by Mair in both the
editorial in issue and earlier editorials were a display of both personal
animosity toward the plaintiff and contempt for her character and her ideas, as
well as a desire to harm her reputation. [para. 70]  The trial
judge also felt that Mair’s editorial was a “display of both personal animosity
toward the plaintiff . . . as well as a desire to harm her reputation” (para.
70). Nevertheless, she concluded that malice was not the dominant motive for
the offending editorial and so did not defeat the defence of fair comment. 
Accordingly, Simpson’s action was dismissed.  B.    British Columbia Court of Appeal (Southin,
Prowse and Thackray JJ.A.) ((2006), 55 B.C.L.R. (4th) 30, 2006 BCCA 287)  [13]
The trial judgment was reversed.  In the view of Southin J.A.,
speaking for herself and Thackray J.A., the trial judge had “failed to apply
the test of honest belief in the defamatory imputation” (para. 34).  The
question, she said, was whether to succeed in the defence of fair comment, the
defendant must honestly believe in the imputation (i.e. the  innuendo that
Simpson “would condone violence toward gay people”, found by the trier of fact)
or “need he only have an honest belief in what he himself subjectively intended
by the words which he used?” (para. 37).  Subjectively, Mair had
intended to convey simply that Simpson is an intolerant bigot.  If that was all
he had said, he would be entitled to succeed because the facts indicate that
this was his honest belief.  However, Southin J.A. pointed out, the trial judge
concluded, in para. 30 of her reasons, that the objectively reasonable
meaning of Mair’s words was that “the plaintiff would condone violence”.  She
held this was an imputation of fact, not comment, and that there was “no
evidentiary foundation for a finding that the appellant would condone violence”
(para. 43).  Prowse J.A. delivered brief concurring reasons.  The case was
therefore sent back to the trial judge for an assessment of damages.  III.   Analysis  [14]
In the almost 30 years since Cherneskey, courts across the
common law world have re-examined the balance between freedom of expression and
the protection of private reputation.  [15]
The function of the tort of defamation is to vindicate
reputation, but many courts have concluded that the traditional elements of
that tort may require modification  to provide broader accommodation to the
value of freedom of expression.  There is concern that matters of public
interest go unreported because publishers fear the ballooning cost and
disruption of defending a defamation action.  Investigative reports get
“spiked”, the Media Coalition contends, because, while true, they are based on
facts that are difficult to establish according to rules of evidence.  When
controversies erupt, statements of claim often follow as night follows day, not
only in serious claims (as here) but in actions launched simply for the purpose
of intimidation.  Of course “chilling” false and defamatory speech is not a bad
thing in itself, but chilling debate on matters of legitimate public
interest raises issues of inappropriate censorship and self-censorship.  Public
controversy can be a rough trade, and the law needs to accommodate its
requirements.  [16]
Canadian courts have frequently pointed to the need to develop
the common law in accordance with Charter  values, including the law of
defamation:  Historically, the common law evolved as a result of
the courts making those incremental changes which were necessary in order to
make the law comply with current societal values.  The Charter 
represents a restatement of the fundamental values which guide and shape our
democratic society and our legal system.  It follows that it is appropriate for
the courts to make such incremental revisions to the common law as may be
necessary to have it comply with the values enunciated in the Charter .  (Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1130,
per Cory J., at para. 92)  See also RWDSU
v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd., [1986] 2 S.C.R. 573, at p. 603.  Traditionally,
the freedom of expression enjoyed by the media has been considered no greater
than that of other members of the Canadian community (Doyle v. Sparrow (1979),
27 O.R. (2d) 206 (C.A.), per MacKinnon A.C.J.O., at p. 208, leave to
appeal refused, [1980] 1 S.C.R. xii).  Nevertheless, it is worth noting that s.
2 (b) of the Charter  specifically refers to “freedom of the press
and other media of communication”, presumably to underline their importance in
our public life.  A.    Imputations
of Fact Versus Comment  [17]
The appellants claim that while the trial judge properly treated
the imputation that Simpson would condone violence as a comment, the Court of
Appeal mischaracterized it as a statement of fact, to which, of course,
different defences apply.  The reasons of the Court of Appeal are not
altogether clear on this point.  Southin J.A., after quoting at length from
various court decisions, concluded without further discussion:  Applying these authorities, I come to the
conclusion that the learned judge’s conclusion, both as judge and jury, as to
the defamatory meaning of these words, excludes any further consideration of
fair comment because there is no evidentiary foundation for a finding
that the appellant would condone violence.  [Emphasis added; para. 43.]  Courts do not
ordinarily refer to a comment as “a finding”, and Southin J.A.’s
characterization persuades the appellants that the Court of Appeal wrongly
reversed the trial judgment  on the basis that the statement in question required factual proof and
therefore could not be defended as fair comment.  They did so without any
deference or indication of a palpable or overriding error by the trial judge in
her finding that the words were comment. [Factum; para. 80]  Imputations of Fact  [18]
The appellants argue that even if the Court of Appeal decided the
appeal on the basis that the imputation “would condone violence” is a fact
requiring a demonstration of truth, and even if the court was correct to do so,
they are, nevertheless, entitled to succeed on the basis of a “responsible
journalism” defence, based on developments in other common law jurisdictions. 
The appellants cite cases in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom on
this point.  [19]
 I do not propose to deal with this argument at length because,
in my view, this is a case of comment, not imputation of fact.  However, having
regard to the full argument placed before us, I will briefly take note of the
contending positions, which will have to await resolution for another appeal.  [20]
In Reynolds v. Times Newspapers Ltd., [1999] 4 All E.R.
609, the House of Lords decided that the common law doctrine of qualified
privilege has enough “elasticity” (p. 625) to accommodate freedom of the media
in a manner consistent with the freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 10
of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and
Fundamental Freedoms.  “[T]here are occasions when the public interest
requires that publication to the world at large should be privileged” (p. 617),
depending on such matters as the seriousness of the allegation, the nature of
the information  published, the extent to which the subject matter is a matter
of public concern, the source of the information and the steps taken to verify
its truth (p. 626).  Where it applies, the “public interest defence of
responsible journalism” protects the journalist even where he or she got
material facts wrong.  Later English authority has noted that the effect of the
Reynolds test is to shift the qualified privilege from the “occasion” to
the specific publication:  Loutchansky v. Times Newspapers Ltd. (Nos.
2-5), [2002] 2 W.L.R. 640, [2001] EWCA Civ 1805.  See also Bonnick v.
Morris, [2003] 1 A.C. 300, [2002] UKPC 31; Jameel v. Wall Street Journal
Europe SPRL, [2006] 4 All E.R. 1279, [2006] UKHL 44; Cusson v. Quan
(2007), 231 O.A.C. 277, 2007 ONCA 771 (leave to appeal granted April 3, 2008,
[2008] 1 S.C.R. xii; hearing pending).  [21]
Reliance was also placed by the appellants on the decisions of
the High Court of Australia which has accepted a more narrow “government or
political matters” defence.  In Lange v. Australian Broadcasting Corp. (1997),
145 A.L.R. 96, at p. 117, it was held that “the reputations of those defamed by
widespread publications will be adequately protected by requiring the publisher
to prove reasonableness of conduct . . . [or] if the person defamed proves that
the publication was actuated by common law malice”.  [22]
As in England, the Australian  adaptation of qualified privilege
would put the onus on the media to prove reasonableness of conduct rather than
on the plaintiff to prove lack of due diligence or negligence.  Moreover, it is
argued that this approach would effectively sideline the issue of malice
because a finding that the media acted reasonably would potentially foreclose a
concurrent finding of malice in respect of the same publication.  [23]
Recent New Zealand authority approaches qualified privilege from
a different perspective.  In Lange v. Atkinson, [2000] 3 N.Z.L.R. 385,
the New Zealand Court of Appeal disagreed with both the House of Lords in Reynolds
and the Australian High Court in Lange, that a “responsible journalism”
or “reasonableness” requirement should be imposed as a condition precedent to
an occasion being classified as one of “qualified privilege”:  We are not persuaded that in the New Zealand situation matters such as
the steps taken to verify the information, the seeking of comment from the
person defamed, and the status or source of the information, should fall within
the ambit of the inquiry into whether the occasion is privileged. [para. 38]  A more
appropriate control mechanism, in the New Zealand view, is to seek flexibility
in the definition of malice, the proof of which lies on the plaintiff.  Thus
the privilege would be defeated if the plaintiff could show either that the
publisher “knew he was not telling the truth or was reckless in that regard”
(para. 51), citing Botiuk v. Toronto Free Press Publications Ltd.,
[1995] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 79.  In effect, the New Zealand doctrine rests on a
public interest doctrine of proof of irresponsible journalism.  [24]
While the legal position in both Australia and New Zealand was
influenced by statutory provisions that have no direct counterpart in Canada,
the Canadian law of qualified privilege will necessarily evolve in ways that
are consistent with Charter  values.  At issue will be both the scope of
the qualified privilege (Reynolds is broader) and whether the burden of
proof of responsible journalism should lie on the defendant (Reynolds)
or irresponsible journalism on the plaintiff (Lange v. Atkinson).  [25]
Despite the variations of the “responsible journalism” defence
urged in argument, the fact is that Mair does not claim to have acted
reasonably in relation to the publication of facts subsequently shown to be
false.  He says he editorialized on facts that were shown to be true. 
Commentators are allowed broad latitude under the existing law of fair
comment.  Despite some ambiguity about the basis of the majority decision of
the B.C. Court of Appeal, as more fully discussed below, fair comment is the
essence of his defence.  B.    Distinguishing
Fact From Comment  [26]
The pleaded innuendo that Simpson was so “hostile toward gay
people to the point that she would condone violence toward gay people”
(trial reasons, at para. 19 (emphasis added; emphasis in original deleted)) is
framed as an inference (“would condone violence”) from a factual premise, (i.e.
was so “hostile toward gay people”).  In Ross v. New Brunswick
Teachers’ Assn. (2001), 201 D.L.R. (4th) 75, 2001 NBCA 62, at para. 56, the
New Brunswick Court of Appeal correctly took the view that “comment” includes a
“deduction, inference, conclusion, criticism, judgment, remark or observation
which is generally incapable of proof”.  Brown’s The Law of Defamation in
Canada (2nd ed. (loose-leaf)) cites ample authority for the proposition
that words that may appear to be statements of fact may, in pith and substance,
be properly construed as comment.  This is particularly so in an editorial
context where loose, figurative or hyperbolic language is used (Brown, vol. 4,
at p. 27-317) in the context of political debate, commentary, media campaigns
and public discourse.  See also, R. D. McConchie and D. A. Potts, Canadian
Libel and Slander Actions (2004), at p. 340.  [27]
The respondent on this appeal did not challenge the view that
Mair’s imputation, that Simpson “would condone violence toward gay people”, was
a comment  not an imputation of fact (Factum, at para. 40).  I agree that the
“sting” of the libel was a comment and it would have been understood as such by
Mair’s listeners.  “What is comment and what is fact must be determined from
the perspective of a ‘reasonable viewer or reader’” (Ross, per
Daigle C.J.N.B., at para. 62).  Mair was a radio personality with opinions on
everything, not a reporter of the facts.  The applicable defence was fair
comment.  On that point, I agree with the trial judge.  C.    The
Test for Fair Comment  [28]
For ease of reference, I repeat and endorse the formulation of
the test for the fair comment defence set out by Dickson J., dissenting, in Cherneskey
as follows:  (a)   the comment must be on a matter of public
interest;  (b)   the comment must be based on fact;  (c)   the comment, though it can include
inferences of fact, must be recognisable as comment;  (d)   the comment must satisfy the following
objective test: could any [person] honestly express that opinion on the proved
facts?  (e)   even though the comment satisfies the
objective test the defence can be defeated if the plaintiff proves that the
defendant was [subjectively] actuated by express malice. [Emphasis added;
emphasis in original deleted; pp. 1099-1100.]  (citing Duncan and Neill on Defamation (1978), at p. 62)  I note,
parenthetically, that Duncan and Neill subsequently reformulated
proposition (d) to say:  “[C]ould any fair-minded man honestly express
that opinion on the proved facts?”;  Duncan and Neill on Defamation (2nd
ed. 1983), at p. 63 (emphasis added).  In my respectful view, the addition of a
qualitative standard such as “fair minded” should be resisted. 
“Fair-mindedness” often lies in the eye of the beholder.  Political partisans
are constantly astonished at the sheer “unfairness” of criticisms made by their
opponents.   Trenchant criticism which otherwise meets the “honest belief”
criterion ought not to be actionable because, in the opinion of a court, it
crosses some ill-defined line of “fair-mindedness”.  The trier of fact is not
required to assess whether the comment is a reasonable and proportional
response to the stated or understood facts.  D.    The
Comment Must Be Based on Fact and Related to a Matter of Public Interest  [29]
The Canadian Civil Liberties Association (“CCLA”) argues that to
bring the common law of defamation into compliance with the Charter 
requires “a presumption in favour of expressive activity”, so that a plaintiff
ought to bear the initial onus of establishing that the defendant’s defamatory
comment (i) is not a comment at all but a fact which must be proven or
otherwise justified, or (ii) is not a comment on a question of public interest.  [30]
I do not think a shift of onus on these points is required.  In
the first place, the Charter  is about “expressive activity” but it also
protects the dignity and worth of individuals, whose reputation may be their
most valued asset.  Plaintiffs must prove defamation to get their case on its
feet.  At that point, it is the media that seeks to excuse defamatory remarks
on the basis that they are “comment” on a “matter of public interest”. 
Ordinary principles of litigation put the burden of proof on the party making
the assertion  (Ontario Equitable Life and Accident Insurance Co. v. Baker,
[1926] S.C.R. 297).  In any event, the onus on these two issues is relatively
easy to discharge.  The public interest is a broad concept.  The cases
establish that the notion of “comment” is generously interpreted.  Putting the
onus on the defendant in these respects is not too high a price to pay for a
defamer to avoid legal liability for an allegation already found to have
wronged the plaintiff’s reputation.  E.     Existence
of a Factual Foundation  [31]
It is true that “[t]he comment must explicitly or implicitly
indicate, at least in general terms, what are the facts on which the comment is
being made”; Brown, vol. 2, p. 15-36, and Gatley on Libel and Slander
(10th ed. 2004), at para. 12.12.  What is important is that the facts be
sufficiently stated or otherwise be known to the listeners that listeners are
able to make up their own minds on the merits of Mair’s editorial comment.  If
the factual foundation is unstated or unknown, or turns out to be false, the
fair comment defence is not available (Chicoutimi Pulp, at p. 194).  [32]
On this point, as mentioned, Southin J.A. concluded that there
could be no “consideration of fair comment because there is no evidentiary
foundation for a finding that the appellant would condone violence” (para.
43).  Perhaps Southin J.A. meant that Mair’s comment was too remote from the
facts to which his listeners understood the comment related, or perhaps she
concluded that Mair’s factual premise that Kari Simpson was so deeply hostile
to the gay community’s initiative was unproven.  Southin J.A. did not
elaborate.  [33]
In Vander Zalm v. Times Publishers (1979), 96 D.L.R. (3d)
172 (B.C.S.C.), the trial court gave judgment for the plaintiff, but the Court
of Appeal, in reversing ((1980), 109 D.L.R. (3d) 531, at p. 536), observed that
the trial judge held that the defence failed because the facts pleaded as the
basis for the alleged comment “could not . . . fairly lead to the
imputation arising from the cartoon” (emphasis added).  The Court of Appeal held
that on making this finding the judge applied the wrong test; the proper test
being whether the comment made by the cartoon met the test of fair comment,
which the evidence indicated that it did.  The trial judge spoke of facts
“fairly” giving rise to the comment, thereby introducing an unwelcome
requirement of reasonableness and proportionality. Southin J.A. in the present
case more prudently spoke of “no evidentiary foundation” (para. 43
(emphasis added)).  [34]
I agree with Southin J.A. that a properly disclosed or
sufficiently indicated (or so notorious as to be already understood by the
audience) factual foundation is an important objective limit to the fair
comment defence, but the general facts giving rise to the dispute between Mair
and Simpson were well known to Mair’s listening audience, and were referred to
in part in the editorial itself.  Simpson’s involvement in the Declaration
of Family Values was familiar to Mair’s audience.  Her repeated invitations
to her followers to pick up the phone and call talk shows and politicians
assured her views a measure of notoriety (Barltrop v. Canadian Broadcasting
Corp. (1978), 25 N.S.R. (2d) 637 (C.A.)).  The respondent has offered no
persuasive reason to justify the Court of Appeal’s interference with the trial
judge’s conclusion that  the defence has established that every element of the factual
foundation was either stated or publicly known; that Mair was aware of them
all; and that they were all substantially true in the sense that they were true
in so far as they go to the pith and substance of the opinion Mair expressed.
[para. 61]  This provides
a sufficient launching pad for the defence of fair comment.  F.     The
Honest Belief Requirement  [35]
The respondent Simpson relies on this Court’s judgment in Cherneskey,
for the proposition, as stated by Ritchie J., at p. 1081, that  it is an essential ingredient to the defence of fair comment that it
must be the honest expression of the writer’s opinion . . . .  Simpson’s
argument on this point therefore runs as follows.  Although the trial judge
found Mair had an honest belief in the comment Mair subjectively thought
he was making (that Simpson is a bigot), there was no evidence that he honestly
believed the innuendo imputed to his words by the trial judge (that
Simpson “would condone violence toward gay people”).  On this view, if Mair had
simply sworn that he honestly believed that Simpson condoned violence (leaving
aside the debate about the ambiguity of the word “condoned”), he would have had
a good defence.  However, Mair undermined his own legal position (so goes the
argument) by persisting at trial in talking about Simpson’s alleged bigotry and
intolerance with the result that he was never asked in chief or
cross-examination about his honest belief in the pleaded innuendo that Simpson
condoned violence.  He stuck to his belief that “Kari Simpson is not a violent
person”.  It seems to me that defamation proceedings will have reached a
troubling level of technicality if the protection afforded by the defence of
fair comment to freedom of expression (“the very lifeblood of our freedom”) is
made to depend on whether or not the speaker is prepared to swear to an honest
belief in something he does not believe he ever said.  (1)   Is There Still a Role for Honest Belief?  [36]
Concern about the obvious anomalies in such a requirement has
prompted the intervener CCLA to urge that “the honest belief requirement be
eliminated” altogether (Factum, at para. 7), despite the description in Cherneskey,
at p. 1082, of honesty of belief as the “cardinal test” of the defence of fair
comment (Ritchie J. quoting Lord Denning in Slim v. Daily Telegraph Ltd.,
[1968] 1 All E.R. 497 (C.A.), at p. 503).  I do not think abolition of the
requirement of honest belief, however formulated, would be “incremental”.  In R.
v. Salituro, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 654, the Court said, at p. 670:  The judiciary should confine itself to those incremental changes which
are necessary to keep the common law in step with the dynamic and evolving
fabric of our society.  Nor does the
desire to evolve the common law to reflect Charter  values require such a
fundamental shift, in my opinion.  [37]
The common law judges long ago decided that the gravamen
of the defence of fair comment would not be the reasonableness or
proportionality of the comment in relation to the facts (which would, of
course, create stronger protection for the person defamed, but would depend in
its application on the mental yardstick employed by a particular court) but
whether the comment reflected honest belief.  The intervener Media Coalition
would substitute for honest belief the requirement that the relationship of the
comment to the facts merely “be one of relevancy” (transcript, at p. 54). 
However, there is a world of difference between an attack made without honest
belief and an attack whose relevance to the underlying facts may be disputed. 
By way of illustration, reference may be made to a famous exchange in the 1954
U.S. Senate Army-McCarthy Hearings when Joseph Welch, counsel to the U.S. army,
denounced the scandal mongering Senator for a smear of one of Welch’s
associates:  “. . . Let us not assassinate this lad further, Senator.  You have done
enough.  Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last?  Have you left no
sense of decency?”  Welch then rose and walked from the room, which exploded in
applause.  (G. R. Stone, “Free Speech in the Age of McCarthy: A Cautionary Tale”
(2005), 93 Cal. L. Rev. 1387, at p. 1402)  The effect of
Welch’s dramatic departure would have been very different had he exited with
the cry: “Have you left no sense of relevance?”  [38]
The relevancy of the comment to the facts has long been part (but
only part) of the fair comment test as is shown in paragraph (b) in Dickson
J.’s list:  see also McQuire v. Western Morning News Co., [1903] 2 K.B.
100 (C.A.), at p. 113.  As Gaynor J. put it in Howarth v. Barlow, 99
N.Y.S. 457 (App. Div. 1906), at p. 459:  That such opinions or inferences are farfetched, highstrung, or
severely moral, or contrary to other opinions or inferences that seem more
reasonable, does not matter so long as there be a basis for them in the acts or
words of the person who is the subject of such criticism.  [39]
Of course it is true that the comment must have “a basis” in the
facts, but a requirement that the comment be “supported by the facts”, read
strictly, might be thought to set the bar so high as to create the potential
for judicial censorship of public opinion. Even  the assessment of “relevance”
has in the past misled courts into asking whether the facts “warranted” the
comment, or whether the comment “fairly” arose out of the facts (Vander Zalm),
or other such judgmental evaluations.  Insistence on a court’s view of
reasonableness and proportionality was thought to represent too great a curb on
free expression, but it was not too much to ask a defamer to profess an honest
belief in his or her defamatory comment.  If the speaker, however misguided,
spoke with integrity, the law would give effect to freedom of expression on
matters of public interest.  [40]
“Honest belief”, of course, requires the existence of a nexus
or relationship between the comment and the underlying facts.  Dickson J.
himself stated the test in Cherneskey as “could any man honestly express
that opinion on the proved facts” (p. 1100 (emphasis added)).  His
various characterizations of “any man” show the intended broadness of the test,
i.e. “however prejudiced he may be, however exaggerated or obstinate his views”
(p. 1103, citing Merivale v. Carson (1887), 20 Q.B.D. 275 (C.A.), at p.
281).  Dickson J. also agreed with the comment in an earlier case that the
operative concept was “honest” rather than “‘fair’ lest some suggestion of
reasonableness instead of honesty should be read in” (p. 1104).  [41]
There is a further practical objection to the proposal of the
CCLA and the Media Coalition to eliminate altogether the honest belief
requirement.  By way of explanation to a jury of what is meant by the test of
whether the comment is based on relevant or true facts, the court would have to
warn the jury not to embark on a reasonableness inquiry.  An effective way of
explaining to the jury how the necessary connection between the comment and the
facts is to be established would be to tell them to ask themselves the
question: Could any person honestly express that opinion on the proved facts? 
We would therefore be back at the point of departure.  (2)   The Cherneskey Case  [42]
Curiously, Cherneskey also involved a strange debate over
the role and function of “honest belief”.  In that case, a couple of law
students had written a provocative letter to the editor of the Saskatoon Star-Phoenix
which was found to have libelled a city alderman as a racist.   The newspaper
published the letter but its publisher testified at trial that he did not agree
with its contents.  The letter writers were not called to testify.  In the
absence of any evidence from anybody associated with its publication that the
letter represented his, her or its “honest belief”, it was held in this Court
by a 6-3 majority that the defence of fair comment was not available because
the newspaper offered no proof that the defamatory opinions were “honestly
held” by the actual writers.  Dickson J., dissenting, pointed out with justice
that  Newspapers will not be able to provide a forum for
dissemination of ideas if they are limited to publishing opinions with which
they agree. . . . The integrity of a newspaper rests not on the
publication of letters with which it is in agreement, but rather on the
publication of letters expressing ideas to which it is violently opposed. [p.
1097]  [43]
The Dickson J. test may be thought to marginalize the “honest
belief” requirement, as it is possible to imagine most silly or ridiculous
opinions finding a home somewhere in the minds of silly or ridiculous people. 
However, his dissent was really driven by an appreciation that the originator
and the publisher of a defamatory comment play different roles.  Nobody expects
the newspaper publisher personally to have an honest belief in all of the
contradictory opinions expressed on a “letters to the editor” page, much of it
inspired by disagreement with something the newspaper itself has said in an editorial. 
Dickson J. was responding to the need to protect free expression on matters of
public interest in a democratic society.  [44]
Nevertheless, it remains true that an effective way to establish
that somebody could “honestly express that opinion on the proved facts” is to
call the defamer (if available) to establish that he or she did indeed
express an honest belief.  As the philosopher Bertrand Russell once observed
with suitable gravity, the existence of a thing is absolute proof of its
possibility.  [45]
Other complexities of the “honest belief” requirement emerge in
the present appeal.  Mair’s editorial about Kari Simpson clearly defamed her. 
Attributing to Simpson bigotry of a type associated with Hitler and a couple of
notoriously racist Governors in the Southern United States at the height of the
desegregation crisis would, I think, tend to lower her in the opinion of
right-thinking people (some might call it a “smear”), and the appellants were
right to concede the point in this Court.  That being the case, it was entirely
proper to have Mair go into the witness box to affirm his honest belief in what
he had said about her.  Yet that was not the end of the issue.  [46]
 The trial judge found a difference between what Mair
subjectively intended to say (Simpson is a bigot) and objectively what he is
taken to have said (Simpson would condone violence).  The gap between the
intended meaning and what the court determined to be the effect Mair’s words
conveyed to reasonable members of the audience has important implications.  On
the test of subjective honest belief applied by the Court of Appeal,
Mair would be robbed of his defence, even though on the public record someone
could honestly express the view imputed to him that Simpson “would
condone violence toward gay people”, and thus the objective honest belief test
would be met.  [47]
It may be noted that such circumstances are not uncommon.  In
much modern media, personalities such as Rafe Mair are as much entertainers as
journalists.  The media regularly match up assailants who attack each other on
a set topic.  The audience understands that the combatants, like lawyers or a
devil’s advocate, are arguing a brief.  What is important in such a debate on
matters of public interest is that all sides of an issue are forcefully
presented, although the limitation that the opinions must be ones that could be
“honestly express[ed] . . . on the proved facts” provides some boundary to the
extent to which private reputations can be trashed in public discourse.  [48]
Of course the law must accommodate commentators such as the
satirist or the cartoonist who seizes on a point of view, which may be quite
peripheral to the public debate, and blows it into an outlandish caricature for
public edification or merriment.  Their function is not so much to advance
public debate as it is to exercise a democratic right to poke fun at those who
huff and puff in the public arena.  This is well understood by the public to be
their function.   The key point is that the nature of the forum or the mode of
expression is such that the audience can reasonably be expected to understand
that, on the basis of the facts as stated or sufficiently indicated to them, or
so generally notorious as to be understood by them, the comment is made tongue-in-cheek
so as to lead them to discount its “sting” accordingly.  In Cherneskey,
Dickson J. emphasized that “the objective limits of fairness [i.e. fair
comment] are very wide” (p. 1109).  The accuracy of this observation is born
out in Vander Zalm where the defendant, a political cartoonist, had
drawn a cartoon of the plaintiff, a Cabinet Minister then holding the office of
Minister of Human Resources in British Columbia, which appeared on the
editorial page of the Victoria Times.  The cartoon, which was uncaptioned,
depicted the plaintiff William Vander Zalm with an evil grin on his face,
seated at a table, and engaged in plucking the wings from a fly.  Other flies,
without wings, were shown moving around on the table.  On the plaintiff’s lapel
were inscribed the words “HUMAN RESOURCES”.  The Court of Appeal found that
both the cartoonist and the Victoria Times publisher had satisfied the
“honest belief” test.  (3)   The Test Is Whether Anyone Could Honestly
Have Expressed the Defamatory Comment on the Proven Facts [49]
The test represents a balance between free expression on matters
of public interest and the appropriate protection of reputation against damage
that exceeds what is required to fulfill free expression requirements.  The
objective test is now widely used in common law jurisdictions as the “honest
belief” component of fair comment, including the United Kingdom: Telnikoff
v. Matusevitch, [1991] 3 W.L.R. 952 (H.L.), quoting with approval Dickson
J.’s dissent, at p. 959.  In Australia, the High Court recently affirmed a
similar approach; see the observation of Gleeson C.J.:  The protection from actionability which the common law gives to fair
and honest comment on matters of public interest is an important aspect of
freedom of speech.  In this context, “fair” does not mean objectively
reasonable.  The defence protects obstinate, or foolish, or offensive
statements of opinion, or inference, or judgment, provided certain conditions
are satisfied.  The word “fair” refers to limits to what any honest person,
however opinionated or prejudiced, would express upon the basis of the relevant
facts.  (Channel Seven Adelaide Pty. Ltd. v. Manock (2007), 241 A.L.R.
468, [2007] HCA 60, at para. 3 (emphasis added))  In New
Zealand, the objective test at common law has now been replaced by a more
subjective test in the Defamation Act 1992 (N.Z.), 1992, No. 105, s.
10.  See generally B. Marten, “A Fairly Genuine Comment on Honest Opinion in
New Zealand” (2005), 36 V.U.W.L.R. 127;  Mitchell v. Sprott,
[2002] 1 N.Z.L.R. 766 (C.A.).  [50]
Admittedly, the “objective” test is not a high threshold for the
defendants to meet, but nor is it in the public interest to deny the defence to
a piece of devil’s advocacy that the writer may have doubts about (but is quite
capable of honest belief) which contributes to the debate on a matter of public
interest.  [51]
Of course, even the latitude allowed by the “objective” honest
belief test may be exceeded.  “Comment must be relevant to the facts to which
it is addressed.  It cannot be used as a cloak for mere invective”; Reynolds,
at p. 615.  (4)   “Malice” Does Not Provide an Adequate
Substitute for the Honest Belief Component of the Fair Comment Defence  [52]
As usual, the debate is about onus:  It is difficult to know whether malice is an
element to be considered independently of the issue of fairness, and thus a
matter which the plaintiff must prove to defeat the defence of fair comment, or
to be treated as part of the issue of fairness, which the defendant must prove
in order to establish that element of the defence. . . . [I]f the issue is
treated as one which goes to the question of fairness, the defendant has the
burden of showing it was fair. This latter position appears to have gained some
acceptance in Ontario.  (Brown, at p. 15-101)  At this point
in the analysis, the comment will have been found to be defamatory and the
defendant is scrambling for a defence.   Interveners supporting the media
suggested that “honest belief”, however formulated, should be pushed into the
analysis of malice, where the plaintiff bears the onus of proof.  Such an
approach would disproportionately favour the media, in my view.  Proof of
malice on the part of the media is generally very difficult.  The media are
well-resourced, secretive about their inner workings and highly protective of
their confidential sources.  At the same time, as many in the U.S. media have
come to learn since New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964),
putting the judicial spotlight on journalistic operations in a malice enquiry
(that is now the fulcrum of a libel case against a public figure) may not be in
anyone’s interest.  I would therefore affirm the present allocation of
proof whereby the defendant must prove the elements of the fair comment defence
(including the objective honest belief requirement) before the onus switches
back to the plaintiff to defeat the defence by establishing, if it can, malice
on the part of the defendant(s).  [53]
Some commentators have suggested that proof of honest belief
negates the possibility of a finding of malice.  This is not necessarily true. 
If a defendant relies on objective honest belief the defence can still
be defeated by proof that subjective malice was the dominant motive of
the particular comment.  G.    Applying
the Law of Fair Comment to the Facts of This Case  [54]
In a lengthy and careful judgment, the trial judge dealt with the
issues in an appropriate sequence:  (1)   What Is the Defamatory Meaning of the
Words Complained of, in Their Full Context?  [55]
At common law, the judge is to make a legal determination
“whether there is a case or an issue to go to the jury” by deciding if the
words are “capable of being a statement of a fact or facts”.  It is then “for
the jury to decide as to what is fact and what is comment” (Court of Appeal
reasons, at para. 42, citing Jones v. Skelton, [1963] 1 W.L.R. 1362
(P.C.), at pp. 1379-80).  As pointed out by the intervener British Columbia
Civil Liberties Association, “the judge’s role in that test is a response to
concerns about freedom of expression” (Factum, at para. 34).  [56]
The “full context” is important.  While argument in this Court
largely focussed on the innuendo that Simpson “would condone violence toward
gay people”, the broader analysis of the trial judge left no doubt about her
view of the “[u]nwholesome virulence” (para. 78) of the editorial taken as a
whole.  The appellants argue that in assessing meaning, the Court is to
consider what reasonable and right-thinking listeners would understand.  The
Court is to avoid putting the worst possible meaning on the words:  Color
Your World Corp. v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp. (1998), 38 O.R. (3d) 97
(C.A.), at pp. 106-7, and Scott v. Fulton (2000), 73 B.C.L.R. (3d) 392,
2000 BCCA 124,  at paras. 13-15.  However, both courts below found that Mair’s
editorial about Simpson was defamatory.  This is a mixed question of law and
fact.  There is no reason to interfere with that conclusion.  It is plainly
correct.  (2)   Do the Words Complained of Relate to a
Matter of Public Interest?  [57]
The public debate about the inclusion in schools of educational
material on homosexuality clearly engages the public interest.  As the Ontario
Court of Appeal recognized over a century ago in words that apply equally to
the case on appeal, “[w]hoever seeks notoriety, or invites public attention, is
said to challenge public criticism; and [s]he cannot resort to the law courts,
if that criticism be less favorable than [s]he anticipated” (Macdonell v.
Robinson (1885), 12 O.A.R. 270, at p. 272).  (3)   Are the Words and the Defamatory Meaning
More Likely to Be Understood, in Context, as Comment Rather Than Fact?  [58]
The trial judge, after reviewing the editorial as a whole,
concluded:  The facts in those statements which are clearly facts are:  1) that
Kari was on Bill Good’s show last Friday; and 2) that she did speak to a rally
the night before.  These facts were true.  There is no other sentence or
statement or phrase which would be understood to be a matter of fact, and
the language in which it is couched is such that it is clearly opinion.
[Emphasis added; para. 44.]  For reasons
stated earlier, I agree with this conclusion.  (4)   Are the Facts Relating to the Comment
Substantially True or Privileged?  [59]
The law requires the comment be based on a sufficient substratum
of facts to anchor the defamatory comment:  Vander Zalm, Court of Appeal
reasons, at p. 536; and Ross, at paras. 73, 78 and 83.  This is another
mechanism to prevent tenuous facts serving as a springboard for defamatory
comment, which, in my view, would be the danger of the “relevance” test
proposed by the CCLA.  Simpson does not dispute the contents or tone of her
speeches in the court record.  In my view, as in the view of the trial judge, the
factual substratum exists.  (5)   Did the Defendants Mair and WIC Radio
Ltd. Satisfy the Honest Belief Requirement?  [60]
Mair testified as to his subjective honest belief in what he
intended to say, but acknowledged that he did not honestly believe that
Simpson would condone violence.  Notwithstanding the absence of a subjective
honest belief that Simpson would condone violence, Mair and WIC Radio, like the
newspaper publisher in Cherneskey, were entitled to rely on the
objective test, i.e. could any person honestly have expressed the innuendo that
Simpson would condone violence toward gay people on the proven facts?  As
mentioned earlier, Simpson’s public speeches were full of references to “war .
. . [where] the spoils turn out to be our children”, “militant homosexuals”,
“[w]ar, you shoot, they shoot” and so on.  Simpson’s use of violent images
could support an honest belief on the part of at least some of her listeners
that she “would condone violence toward gay people”, even though Mair denied
that he intended to impute any such meaning.  [61]
The respondent, Simpson, emphasizes the distinction taken by the
B.C. Court of Appeal between what Mair thought he was saying (that Simpson was
a non-violent person whose loose words inadvertently opened the door to less
peaceable individuals to resort to violence) and the specific defamatory
imputation that was found to have arisen from the words Mair used (i.e. that
Simpson “would condone violence toward gay people”).   It makes little sense to
deny the defence of fair comment to a speaker whose opinion has been
misunderstood, even if carelessness in the use of words is the source of the
misunderstanding.  The Court of Appeal framed the issue as follows:  “Is it the
law that to succeed in the defence of fair comment, the defendant must honestly
believe in the imputation,  . . . or need he only have an honest belief in what
he himself subjectively intended by the words which he used?” (para. 37).  In
its view, the former requirement applied.  I do not think the “either/or”
question of the Court of Appeal exhausts the possibilities.  On the contrary, I
think the proper question is whether the defamatory imputation that Kari
Simpson “would condone violence toward gay people” is an opinion that could be
held by an honest person in the circumstances.  [62]
The trial judge concluded that Mair honestly believed what he
thought he had said:  I consider that Mair was on a “campaign” to expose what Mair believed
were Simpson’s “irresponsible” statements and speeches against the teaching of
tolerance of a homosexual lifestyle in public schools.  This, together with the
overall content of the defamatory editorial, is evidence supporting a finding
that the dominant motive for publishing the editorial was Mair’s honestly
held opinion.  [Emphasis added; para. 84.]  The trial
judge did not explicitly apply the “objective honest belief” test to the
imputation that Simpson “would condone violence”.  In my view, however, having
regard to the trial judge’s reasons as a whole, and considering both the
content of some of Simpson’s speeches already mentioned, and the broad latitude
allowed by the defence of fair comment, the defamatory imputation that while
Simpson would not engage in violence herself she “would condone violence” by
others, is an opinion that could honestly have been expressed on the proved
facts by a person “prejudiced . . . exaggerated or obstinate  [in] his views”.
That is all that the law requires.  (6)   Has the Respondent Proven Sufficient
Malice on the Appellants’ Part to Defeat the Defence?  [63]
The defence is defeated if the commentary was actuated by malice
in the sense of improper motive, proof of which lay on the plaintiff.  Simpson
does not appeal against the trial judge’s conclusion that Mair’s fair comment
defence was not vitiated by malice.  IV.  Conclusion  [64]
Applying the elements of the fair comment defence set out above,
I conclude that the trial judge was correct to allow the defence.  V.    Disposition  [65]
I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of
Appeal and restore the trial judgment dismissing the action, with costs
throughout.  The following are the reasons delivered by  [66]
LeBel J. — Although
I agree with Binnie J. that the appellants are not liable in defamation, I
arrive at this conclusion in a different way.  In particular, I am not
convinced that Mr. Mair’s comments were prima facie defamatory. 
Further, I disagree that the fair comment defence should include an element of
honest belief.  Rather, to establish fair comment, the defendant should simply
have to show that the impugned words constituted comment, that they had a basis
in fact and that they concerned a matter of public interest. I accept the facts
as they are set out by the majority, and I agree that this case is one of
comment rather than of fact. I will therefore proceed directly to an analysis
of the defamatory nature of the comment and the requirement of honest belief. 
I will conclude with a brief review of the existing test for malice, which I
endorse and apply.  (1)  Whether
Mair’s Comments Were Defamatory  [67]
The issue of whether Mair’s comments were in fact prima facie defamatory
was not raised on appeal to this Court, and I would therefore not interfere
with the trial judge’s finding in this regard.  However, I disagree with Binnie
J.’s observations that the trial judge’s conclusion on this point was “plainly
correct” (para. 56) and that the editorial “clearly defamed” Ms. Simpson (para.
45).  Some discussion on this issue is warranted.  Although defamation is not
easily defined, one generally accepted test is the one from Salmond on the
Law of Torts (17th ed. 1977), at pp. 139-40, which is based on the test
proposed by Lord Atkin in Sim v. Stretch (1936), 52 T.L.R. 669 (H.L.),
at p. 671, and was approved by the B.C. Court of Appeal in Vander Zalm v.
Times Publishers (1980), 109 D.L.R. (3d) 531, at p. 535:    [68]
This test is often construed as setting a low threshold for
establishing prima facie defamation.  Gatley on Libel and Slander
(10th ed. 2004) (“Gatley”), notes that “it may well be the case that the
common law takes a rather generous line on what lowers a person in the
estimation of others” (p. 18, footnote 32).  Dickson J. made a similar point in
Cherneskey v. Armadale Publishers Ltd., [1979] 1 S.C.R. 1067, in
referring to the “low level of the threshold which a statement must pass in
order to be defamatory” (p. 1095).   [70]
It should go without saying that people evaluate statements of
opinion differently than statements of fact.  In discussing what constitutes a
statement of fact as opposed to comment, Lord Herschell noted that  the distinction cannot be too clearly borne in mind between comment or
criticism and allegations of fact, such as that disgraceful acts have been
committed, or discreditable language used.  It is one thing to comment upon or
criticise, even with severity, the acknowledged or proved acts of a public man,
and quite another to assert that he has been guilty of particular acts of
misconduct.  (Davis & Sons v. Shepstone (1886), 11 App. Cas. 187 (P.C.),
at p. 190)    [71]
Although distinguishing facts from comment may sometimes be
difficult, a comment is by its subjective nature generally less capable of
damaging someone’s reputation than an objective statement of fact, because the
public is much more likely to be influenced in its belief by a statement of
fact than by a comment.  I therefore agree with the following observation by R.
E. Brown:  If the expression of opinion by the defendant on
facts which are true are reasonably understood by those to whom they are
published as opinions, and nothing else, they say nothing derogatory about the
plaintiff which does not already inhere in the facts that have been recited. 
It is those facts that are damning, either to the plaintiff because the opinion
expressed is so consistent with the true facts which are recited and
approximate the subjective opinion of those to whom they are published, or to
the defendant because they are so inconsistent with the recited facts and with
the subjective opinion of those to whom they are published.  In the former
case, the reputation of the plaintiff is not adversely affected by the
publication of the opinion; in the latter case, it is the defendant who is
defamed by his or her own foolish words rather than the plaintiff.  (Defamation Law: A Primer (2003), at p. 185)  [72]
There is no doubt that a comment may be defamatory.  It must
simply be borne in mind that just because someone expresses an opinion does not
mean that it will be believed and therefore affect its subject’s reputation.  [73]
This is all the more true in an age when the public is exposed to
an astounding quantity and variety of commentaries on issues of public
interest, ranging from political debate in the House of Commons, to newspaper
editorials, to comedians’ satire, to a high school student’s blog.  It would
quite simply be wrong to assume that the public always takes statements of
opinion at face value.  Rather, members of the public must be presumed to
evaluate comments in accordance with their own knowledge and opinions about the
speaker and the subject of the comments.  [74]
Members of the public will generally have a more solid basis on
which to evaluate a comment about a public figure than one about someone who is
unknown.  Thus, although public figures are certainly more open to criticism
than those who avoid the public eye, this does not mean that their reputations
are necessarily more vulnerable.  In fact, public figures may have greater
opportunity to influence their own reputations for the better.    [77]
Thus, although associating the respondent’s bigotry with Hitler
would clearly be defamatory if taken at face value, the test for defamation is
a contextual one and relates to what people would think in the circumstances of
publication of the comments (Gatley, at pp. 108-10).  In the context of
this particular debate, I do not believe that Mair’s audience would have taken
his comments at face value.  To paraphrase Professor Brown, Simpson’s
reputation was not adversely affected, either because Mair’s opinions were
consistent with the facts and approximated the subjective opinions of his
listeners, or because Mair’s opinion was not consistent with the facts and the
subjective opinions of his listeners and only reflected badly on Mair himself.  [78]
Triers of fact should be mindful of ensuring that the plaintiff’s
reputation is actually threatened by the impugned statements before turning to
the available defences.  I do not mean to imply that damage to reputation must
be proved, since actual harm to reputation is not required to establish
defamation.  However, before a prima facie case can be made out, there
must be a realistic threat that the statement, in its full context, would
reduce a reasonable person’s opinion of the plaintiff.  In my view, Mair’s
comments posed no realistic threat to Kari Simpson’s reputation, and I would
therefore not have found them to be prima facie defamatory.  [79]
If, however, the traditional test were so narrow as to catch the
comments made in Mair’s editorial, then in my opinion, it would be unduly
restrictive and would need to be expanded to better reflect the values of
modern Canadian society.  The law of defamation — whose purpose is to protect
reputation — exists as a limitation on freedom of expression, which is
protected by s. 2 (b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . 
Reputation is an important element of human dignity and must be protected. 
However, even if a fair comment defence is available, it cannot be consistent
with the Charter  value of freedom of expression to treat spirited
statements of opinion in a debate on matters of public interest as being prima
facie defamatory.  [80]
As I mentioned above, since the issue was not raised before us, I
would not interfere with the lower courts’ finding that the editorial was
defamatory.  Further, since I agree that the defence of fair comment applies,
it is not necessary to the proper disposition of this appeal to resolve this
issue.  However, I consider it important to state my discomfort with the
majority’s assessment that the editorial “clearly defamed” Simpson (para. 45).  (2)  Honest
Belief as an Element of Fair Comment  [81]
The majority would retain a requirement of honest belief in the
fair comment defence primarily on the basis: (a) that to eliminate it would constitute
more than an incremental change to the law (para. 36); and (b) that it provides
additional and appropriate protection to reputation beyond that afforded by the
malice and “based on fact” inquiries (see para. 49).  I disagree with both
these propositions.  [82]
The first proposition is based on the fact that honest belief is
the “cardinal test” of fair comment in Canada (para. 36).  This may be so, but
a closer examination of fair comment reveals that it is subjective rather than
objective honest belief that is considered the cardinal test of fair comment. 
Further, in Commonwealth countries such as the U.K., Australia and New Zealand,
the requirement of a subjective honest belief exists only as an aspect of the
malice inquiry in respect of which the burden of proof is on the plaintiff, not
as an actual element of the defence.  As for objective honest belief, although
Commonwealth countries such as the U.K. and Australia retain an objective
element in the defence, they have recognized that in the context of fair
comment, there is no longer any justification for judging the reasonableness of
the content of opinions.  An objective honest belief requirement conflicts with
the principle that even unreasonable comments should be protected in a democratic
society.  Thus, the common law in the U.K., Australia and Canada has gradually
moved away from assessing comment in terms of reasonableness.  [83]
I also disagree with the second proposition, which assumes that
an honest belief requirement provides appropriate protection to reputation
beyond that provided by other elements of the fair comment defence (including
malice, which is, strictly speaking, not an element of the defence).  I will
begin by reviewing the U.K. decisions that established subjective honest belief
as the “cardinal test” of fair comment.  I will then discuss the history and
the current role of the objective honest belief requirement.  I will conclude
by demonstrating that, in any event, an objective honest belief requirement
provides little or no additional protection to reputation.  [83a]           In
Slim v. Daily Telegraph Ltd., [1968] 1 All E.R. 497 (C.A.), Lord Denning
stated:   The important thing is to determine whether or not the writer was
actuated by malice.  If he was an honest man expressing his genuine opinion on
a subject of public interest, . . . he has a good defence of fair comment.  His
honesty is the cardinal test. [p. 503]   [84]
Although it is not entirely clear from Slim who has the
burden of proving or disproving subjective honest belief, it is settled law in
the U.K. that this burden falls to the plaintiff once the elements of fair
comment are proved:  [A] comment which falls within the objective limits of the defence of
fair comment can lose its immunity only by proof that the defendant did not
genuinely hold the view he expressed.  Honesty of belief is the touchstone. 
Actuation by spite, animosity, intent to injure, intent to arouse controversy
or other motivation, whatever it may be, even if it is the dominant or sole
motive, does not of itself defeat the defence.  However, proof of such
motivation may be evidence, sometimes compelling evidence, from which lack of
genuine belief in the view expressed may be inferred.  (Cheng v. Tse Wai Chun (2000), 3 H.K.C.F.A.R. 339, at pp. 360-61
(emphasis in original), per Lord Nicholls, cited in Gatley, at
p. 310)    [85]
Thus, the “cardinal test” of fair comment — at least in the U.K.
— is subjective rather than objective honest belief, and it is the plaintiff
who bears the burden of proof in the context of the malice inquiry. That being
said, my colleague correctly notes that the requirement of an objective honest
belief persists in the defence of fair comment in some common law countries,
and he concludes that to excise it from Canadian law would constitute more than
an incremental change.  I disagree.  Although this requirement does continue to
exist in some common law countries, its influence and utility have been waning
such that, in my opinion, it no longer offers anything of value in the exercise
of balancing the right to comment fairly on matters of public opinion against
the right to reputation.  Doing away with it may constitute a significant
change to the form of the test for fair comment, but the effect of
doing so would not be to modify the scope of the defence in any significant
way.  The advantage of eliminating the objective honest belief requirement, on
the other hand, is that this would constitute formal recognition of what some
common law courts have been saying for decades: that it is no longer
justifiable, for purposes of the fair comment defence, to judge a person’s
opinions on an objective basis other than to require that they have some basis
in fact.  [86]
In the U.K., fair comment is a “two stage” issue.  At the first
stage, the defendant establishes that the words are objectively capable of
constituting comment.  At the second stage, the plaintiff may attempt to prove
malice, which will defeat the protection of the defence (Gatley, at p.
311).  The objective stage incorporates both objective honest belief and
relevance to the underlying facts.  At one time, fair comment was limited to
what was objectively “fair, reasonable and temperate” (Soane v. Knight (1827),
M. & M. 74, 173 E.R. 1086, at p. 1086, cited in P. Mitchell, The Making
of the Modern Law of Defamation (2005), at p. 174).  Eventually, however,
this view was held to be overly restrictive of speech on matters of public
interest.  In Merivale v. Carson (1887), 20 Q.B.D. 275 (C.A.), Lord
Esher held that the correct test was whether any “fair man, however prejudiced”
could hold the impugned opinion (p. 280).  Later, even the word “fair”, which
gave the defence of fair comment its name, was replaced by the word “honest” to
eliminate any residual requirement of reasonableness (see Mitchell, at
p. 181.  See also Dickson J. dissenting in Cherneskey, at p.
1104.) The objective reasonableness of the opinion was held to be of no
relevance in limiting fair comment.  As early as 1863, the English courts held
that the defendant’s opinion need not be reasonable.  Rather, in addition to
subjective honest belief, a jury must simply find that the defendant’s “belief
was not without foundation” (Campbell v. Spottiswoode (1863), 3
B. & S. 769, 122 E.R. 288, at p. 290).  [I]f the language complained of is such as can be fairly called
criticism, the mere circumstance that it is violent, exaggerated, or even in a
sense unjust, will not render it unfair.  It is at the most evidence that it
was not an honest expression of real opinion, but was inspired by malice.  (Gatley, at p. 306, citing McQuire v. Western Morning News
Co., [1903] 2 K.B. 100 (C.A.), at p. 110.)   [87]
This history is reflected in the words of Lord Nicholls in
Reynolds v. Times Newspapers Ltd., [1999] 4 All E.R. 609, at p. 615:    [88]
Some Canadian courts have cited this passage from Reynolds
with approval.  For example, in Ross v. New Brunswick Teachers’ Assn. (2001),
201 D.L.R. (4th) 75, 2001 NBCA 62, the New Brunswick Court of Appeal quoted it
and then went on to conclude:  Therefore, for a comment to be protected by a plea
of fair comment, the comment must be relevant to the facts to which it is
addressed, but it need not be reasonable nor one with which the trier of fact
agrees. It need only be proven to be “fair” or “relevant” in the sense that
the comment relates to the proven underlying facts on which the commentator
relies and represents an honest expression of the real view of the person
making the comment. [Emphasis added; para. 78.]   [89]
These passages confirm that little is left of the objective
“fairness” requirement other than that a comment must be “relevant to the facts
to which it is addressed”.  However, despite the waning role of the objective
honest belief requirement, it seems that British law, like Canadian and
Australian law, still requires a trier of fact to ask: “Would any [honest] man,
however prejudiced he might be, or however exaggerated or obstinate his views,
have written this criticism?” (Gatley, at p. 307).  Alternately,
in the words of Dickson J. in Cherneskey, at p. 1100, as endorsed by the
majority in this case, “could any man honestly express that opinion on the
proved facts?”  What, then, does it mean that a person could honestly express
that opinion on the proved facts?  [90]
If the speaker’s prejudices or inclination toward exaggeration
and obstinacy are irrelevant, it would similarly be irrelevant to consider the
objective reasonableness of the comment aside from the requirement that it have
a basis in fact.  This is certainly consistent with the shift away from the
idea that fairness amounts to reasonableness.  For example, in Cherneskey,
Dickson J. substituted the word “honest” for “fair” in the objective test
“lest some suggestion of reasonableness instead of honesty should be read in”
(p. 1104).  In this context, then, “honest belief” must refer either to whether
someone could express the comment with an honest motive or to whether someone
could believe the comment if he or she were being honest with him or herself. 
In the former case, since a dishonest motive for publication can defeat a fair
comment defence in the malice inquiry, it would seem redundant to inquire into
the defendant’s motives at the honest belief stage of the defence.  In the
latter case, the “honest belief” label would also be redundant, since what one
does not honestly believe, one does not believe at all.  This relates to
subjective honest belief, albeit to what someone could subjectively believe
rather than to what the defendant subjectively believed.  I take this to be the
sense in which the majority, and the courts generally, use the expression
“honest belief”.  [91]
The requirement that someone be capable of believing the comment
in light of the facts does not do away with the problem of assessing the
objective reasonableness of the comment.  It is not clear how — other than by
requiring a simple basis in fact — the limits to what someone could
subjectively believe can be determined without resorting to objective
reasonableness.  Admittedly, the threshold for establishing a factual basis for
a comment remains low.  However, the threshold for establishing that someone
could believe the comment on the basis of the relevant facts is also low.  The
tests involve similar, if not identical, questions.  Where a comment is
objectively incapable of belief, this will presumably be because it does not
have a basis in fact.  If there is any difference between what is capable of
belief and what is based in fact, it must relate to what is reasonable for a
person to believe, given certain facts.  As I mentioned above, common law
courts, including those in Canada, have long rejected an approach that involves
judging the objective reasonableness of a comment.  [92]
The honest belief inquiry adopted by the majority, which is
clearly not intended to assess the objective reasonableness of the comment,
must therefore be an inquiry into whether the comment has a basis in fact. 
Binnie J. acknowledges as much by noting that a jury could be instructed to
determine whether comment has a basis in fact by asking whether a person could
honestly express the opinion on the proved facts (para. 41).  I agree that this
is a useful jury instruction regarding the “basis in fact” element.  But what,
then, is the additional benefit of a distinct element of honest belief?  The
defence of fair comment would include two elements — basis in fact and honest
belief — that address exactly the same issue.  [93]
Since the elements address the same issue, honest belief provides
no additional protection for reputation.  For example, an honest belief test
would not protect against a bad faith attack made without honest belief, such
as Senator McCarthy’s smear campaign of the 1950s.  Such attacks would pass the
majority’s honest belief test so long as they constituted comment that someone
could believe.  In the context of McCarthyism, someone could very well have
believed defamatory allegations relating to communism.  If no one could believe
the allegations, it must be because they have no basis in fact, and the defamer
could not rely on the fair comment defence.  Further, even without an honest belief
element, a plaintiff who is the victim of a bad faith attack may prevail by
demonstrating malice.   [95]
Even though, in principle, I do not consider it appropriate to
exclude from fair comment that which no honest person could believe, it is
nevertheless true that in practice, such speech will rarely, if ever, be
protected as fair comment even without an honest belief requirement.  This is
because in defamation law, reputation is already protected in three ways from
comments that are not “fair” in the sense of being objectively capable of
belief on the relevant facts.  [96]
First, to the extent that, as discussed above, honest belief and
basis in fact amount to the same inquiry, whatever has no basis in fact is not
capable of belief, and vice versa.  However, even if there were some
difference between the two concepts, two other aspects of fair comment protect
reputation against objectively unbelievable comment.  [97]
For a comment to be prima facie defamatory, there must be
a possibility that its audience will believe it; otherwise, it cannot harm the
plaintiff’s reputation.  The audience is presumed to consist of “ordinary,
reasonable, fair-minded” people (Charleston v. News Group Newspapers Ltd.,
[1995] 2 W.L.R. 450 (H.L.), at p. 454).  The test is not whether any person, no
matter how unreasonable or unfair, could think less of the plaintiff because of
the comment.  Therefore, the more disconnected the comment is from its
underlying facts, the less likely it is to be defamatory.  It follows that comments
that are not capable of objective honest belief, given the relevant facts, will
rarely be defamatory.  For example, in a modern developed society, an
imputation that someone practises witchcraft would not be defamatory, because
it would not be believed and therefore would not harm the plaintiff’s
reputation (Loukas v. Young, [1968] 3 N.S.W.R. 549 (S.C.)). 
Thus, the test for prima facie defamation, if correctly applied, will
exclude from protection many situations involving comments that are not capable
of objective honest belief.  [98]
Further, it is difficult to imagine any situation in which a
comment with a basis in true facts that would be incapable of belief could be
made with a motive that is not predominantly malicious.  By definition, the
publisher of the comment would not believe the opinions he or she expressed. 
Why would someone publish a comment that he or she does not believe and that no
one else could honestly believe, if not out of malice?  The dominant motive
could not be for the sake of argument, since no one could believe the comment. 
Nor could it be a desire to report on issues of public interest, because here
again, no one could believe the comment.  [99]
I am therefore of the opinion that the only additional protection
for reputation afforded by a requirement of objective honest belief is an
inappropriate one, in that it places a reasonableness restriction on the
opinions a person may legitimately express.  The common law courts in this
country and in the U.K. have long been uncomfortable with the idea of limiting
fair comment to what is reasonable, even in the broadest sense.  The time has
come to formally acknowledge that such a reasonableness requirement has
outlived its purpose and that, in any event, in its present broad form, it
provides little or no protection for reputation.  In my opinion, therefore, the
defence of fair comment should simply require the defendant to prove (a) that
the statement constituted comment, (b) that it had a basis in true facts and
(c) that it concerned a matter of public interest.  On the facts of this case,
there is no dispute that each of these requirements is met.  (3)  Malice  [100]     
If the defendant is successful in establishing the elements of
the fair comment defence, the inquiry may turn to malice, which the plaintiff
must prove if he or she alleges it.  I see no reason to alter the existing
burden of proof.  To require the defendant to prove a lack of malice would
amount to presuming malice.  A society that seeks to promote healthy debate
should require evidence of a malicious motive before restricting the expression
of opinions based on true facts that concern matters of public interest.  It
would protect spirited — but not mean-spirited — speech. Proof of malice may be
intrinsic or extrinsic: that is, it may be drawn from the language of the
assertion itself or from the circumstances surrounding the publication of the
comment.  It may involve inferences and evidentiary presumptions.  [101]     
I also see no reason to alter the nature of the malice inquiry. 
In Cherneskey, Dickson J. described malice as follows:  Malice is not limited to spite or ill will, although these are its most
obvious instances. Malice includes any indirect motive or ulterior purpose, and
will be established if the plaintiff can prove that the defendant was not
acting honestly when he published the comment. This will depend on all the
circumstances of the case. Where the defendant is the writer or commentator
himself, proof that the comment is not the honest expression of his real
opinion would be evidence of malice. If the defendant is not the writer or
commentator himself, but a subsequent publisher, obviously this is an
inappropriate test of malice. Other criteria will be relevant to determine
whether he published the comment from spite or ill will, or from any other
indirect and dishonest motive. [p. 1099]    [103]     
I would not adopt the British malice test (reproduced here for
convenience), which is based on honesty of belief rather than the motive for
publication.  [A] comment which falls within the objective limits of the defence of
fair comment can lose its immunity only by proof that the defendant did not
genuinely hold the view he expressed.  Honesty of belief is the touchstone. 
Actuation by spite, animosity, intent to injure, intent to arouse controversy
or other motivation, whatever it may be, even if it is the dominant or sole
motive, does not of itself defeat the defence.  However, proof of such
motivation may be evidence, sometimes compelling evidence, from which lack of
genuine belief in the view expressed may be inferred.  (Cheng v. Tse Wai Chun, at pp. 360-61 (emphasis in original);
see also Gatley, at p. 310.)   [104]     
In the U.K., the motive for publication appears to be relevant
only with respect to secondary publishers: malice will not be found where
someone publishes the opinions of others without malicious intent (Gatley,
at pp. 310-11).  However, there are good reasons for maintaining a malice
test that withholds protection from a comment expressed with a predominantly
malicious motive.  As Greer L.J. noted in Watt v. Longsdon, [1930] 1
K.B. 130 (C.A.), at pp. 154-55, quoted with approval by the B.C. Court of
Appeal in Christie v. Westcom Radio Group Ltd. (1990), 75 D.L.R. (4th)
546, at p. 554, leave to appeal refused, [1991] 1 S.C.R. vii:  A man may believe in the truth of a defamatory statement, and yet when
he publishes it be reckless whether his belief be well founded or not. His
motive for publishing a libel on a privileged occasion may be an improper one,
even though he believes the statement to be true. . . .  I agree with the
statement of the law contained in the late Mr. Blake Odgers’ monumental book on
libel and slander, which will be found at p. 354 of the 5th edition. . . .: “An
angry man may often be led away into exaggerated or unwarrantable expressions;
or he may forget where and in whose presence he is speaking, or how and to whom
his writing may be published. Clearly this is often but faint evidence of
malice; the jury will generally pardon a slight excess of righteous zeal. In
some cases, however . . . such excess has secured the plaintiff the verdict . .
.”.   [105]     
Similarly, an Australian court has noted that “personal animosity
may perfectly well consort with sincerity to produce a comment which is harmful
and unfair” (Renouf v. Federal Capital Press of Australia Pty. Ltd. (1977),
17 A.C.T.R. 35 (S.C.), at p. 54).  Australia maintains essentially the same
test of malice as exists in Canada: whether malice was the dominant motive for
publication (see M. Gillooly, The Law of Defamation in Australia and New
Zealand (1998), at pp. 132-33).  [106]     
The requirement that malice be the dominant motive for
expressing an opinion in order to defeat fair comment helps maintain a proper
balance between protecting freedom of expression and reputation.  Arguments
between ideologically-opposed participants in a public debate often breed
bitterness, but such debate remains valuable and worthy of protection in a
democratic society.  However, while it is not appropriate to judge the
objective fairness of an opinion, the protection of reputation may justify
judging the motive for expressing it.  After all, the purpose of the fair
comment defence is to protect and encourage free debate on issues of public
importance.  Opinions published with the primary intention of injuring another
person (for example), rather than furthering public debate, are sufficiently far
removed from the type of speech the defence was intended to protect that they
may justifiably be excluded from the scope of its protection.  [107]     
The trial judge concluded that malice was not the dominant
motivation for publication and, for the above reasons, I would allow the appeal
and dismiss the action with costs throughout.  The following are the reasons delivered by  [108]     
Rothstein J. — I
have had the benefit of reading the reasons of my colleagues Binnie J. and
LeBel J.  I agree with Binnie J. that the statements in question were
defamatory but that the defence of fair comment applies.  [109]     
However, I disagree that to satisfy the fair comment defence,
there is a requirement to prove objective honest belief.  On this issue, I am
in agreement with the reasons and analysis of LeBel J.  The defence of fair
comment should only require the defendant to prove (a) that the statement
constituted comment, (b) that it had a basis in true facts and (c) that it
concerned a matter of public interest; and these requirements were met in this
case.  Although the issue of malice is not before the Court on this appeal, I
also agree with LeBel J.’s discussion in respect of the element of malice.  [110]     
If objective honest belief means the honest belief of anyone, no
matter how “prejudiced . . . exaggerated or obstinate” in his or her views, I
cannot think of an example in which the test of objective honest belief could
not be met once it is demonstrated that the comment has a basis in true facts. 
In my respectful view, the test of objective honest belief adds only an
unnecessary complexity to the analysis of fair comment.  [111]     
I agree with Binnie J. that the trial judge’s conclusion that the
fair comment defence was not vitiated by malice was not appealed.  [112]     
Like both Binnie and LeBel JJ., I would allow the appeal with
costs throughout and dismiss the action.                                                                      APPENDIX  Transcript
of CKNW editorial broadcast of October 25, 1999  RAFE MAIR: And
a very pleasant Monday, the 25th of October.  Around the province of British
Columbia on the WIC network I’m Rafe Mair broadcasting from the Pacific Centre
in downtown Vancouver.  I really hate
to give Kari Simpson any more publicity, something she soaks up like a blotter,
but she’s become such a menace I really think something must be said.  When I
first knew Kari some 8 or 9 years ago she was involved in helping families
whose children had been wrongfully taken by the authorities.  She and I did a
number of programmes on this, and this programme was nominated for a Michener
Award as a consequence.  Even more importantly the Ombudsman looked into the
matter and changes were made.  I felt very good about what Kari had done — she’d
done excellent work — and what I’d been able to do by way of giving it some
publicity.  We worked together on other matters until it gradually became
apparent to me that Kari was starting to become a little too uncritical of the
causes she was taking.  We both went overboard in the case of a lawyer’s
complaints against authorities.  Although there was something in what he said,
he went too far and he had to apologize.  Then Kari got involved in a case
where a Langley family didn’t want their daughter to be forced to take
essential medical treatment and the child died.  There were other cases, one
involving Munchausen’s Syndrome, where Kari not only defied authority — nothing
wrong with that — but she began to quarrel with experts, not based on another expert’s
opinion but on her own, offering as her qualifications that she was a mom.  I
began to wonder what had happened.  Instead of well researched opinions Kari
was now proceeding from a semi-religious base, and it was not long before the
gay community was in her sights.  The next thing I knew an editorial of mine
stating my belief in the civil liberties of all including gays brought a letter
from her claiming that I was in favour of grown men molesting young boys.  To
say the least I was taken aback, and after demanding an apology and not getting
one told my producers that I no longer wish to have anything to do with her. 
Now, part of that I admit was personal.  Who wouldn’t be mortified of being
accused of supporting paedophilia but most of it was that I could no longer
trust her judgment, and I certainly couldn’t judge what she presented as fact.  Then Kari got
involved in the recall effort against Paul Ramsey in Prince George — Kari lives
in Langley — on the basis that he was soft on the gay issue in the Surrey
school system, those two harmless or three harmless books that the School Board
and some of the parents had set their hair on fire all about.  By this time in
my view Kari had become unbalanced on the subject.  I could only conclude and
it’s still my opinion that once her organization got a little bigger and got
some funds it went to Kari’s head, but that’s just what I think.  Whatever,
she’s become more than just a little hung up on gays in the school system and
more than just a little disingenuous when she claims that she doesn’t really
have anything against homosexuals.  This latest business in Surrey is a
disgrace.  That parents would start taking children out of school because the
teacher is a gay is beyond my comprehension.  Everyone that I know had a gay
teacher somewhere along the line.  I had two that I know of.  One was a man and
he was a good teacher, no more nor less than that, but his sexual preferences
had no impact whatever on either of us.  The other, even though she is long
dead, I will simply call Miss L.  Miss L. was my music teacher in grades 3 and
4, and she was superb.  I learned to read music at that young age thanks to
her.  What is fascinating about Miss L. was that in those days, the early 40’s,
she was living in an open lesbian relationship, unheard of and more than just a
bit courageous and was bringing up a young boy who eventually became a
distinguished professional having a happily married life and family.  I didn’t
know Miss L. was a lesbian then although I did by the time I was in junior high
school, and I can tell you she’s one of the three or four teachers I’ve had who
had a profoundly positive effect on my learning.  I tell you this because I
don’t think that there are very many of you listening who didn’t have a gay teacher
somewhere, whether you knew it or not.  Before Kari
was on my colleague Bill Good’s show last Friday I listened to the tape of the
parents’ meeting the night before where Kari harangued the crowd.  It took me
back to my childhood when with my parents we would listen to bigots who with
increasing shrillness would harangue the crowds.  For Kari’s homosexual one
could easily substitute Jew.  I could see Governor Wallace — in my mind’s eye I
could see Governor Wallace of Alabama standing on the steps of a schoolhouse
shouting to the crowds that no Negroes would get into Alabama schools as long
as he was governor.  It could have been blacks last Thursday night just as
easily as gays.  Now I’m not suggesting that Kari was proposing or supporting
any kind of holocaust or violence but neither really — in the speeches, when
you think about it and look back — neither did Hitler or Governor Wallace or
[Orval Faubus] or Ross Barnett.  They were simply declaring their hostility to
a minority.  Let the mob do as they wished.  As I listened
to Kari Simpson I wondered about her, but I also wondered what was the matter
with those parents, and my colleague Bill Good said it all on Friday when he
said he’d rather have a competent gay teacher teach his kids than a vicious gay-basher. 
Don’t make any mistake on this score.  There is no distinction between
condemning the rights of blacks or Jews and condemning the civil rights of
homosexuals.  Whether she realizes it or not, Kari has by her actions placed
herself alongside skinheads and the Ku Klux Klan.  I’m not talking the violent
aspects of those groups but the philosophical parallels to other examples of
intolerance.  What’s next on
the agenda in Surrey?  Will there be a 1999 version of the Scopes trial in Tennessee
in the 20’s whereafter the legal fight of the century between William Jennings
Bryan and Clarence Darrow, a teacher named John Scopes was found guilty of
teaching evolution?  Or will it get even nastier with someone suitably
impressed with the wisdom of Kari’s rantings deciding to take the law into his
own hands and do God’s work?  We all live under the law, my friends, and we
live under a law which guarantees everyone rights, whatever their race, creed,
sex, marital status or sexual preference, and the tactics of the bigot are the
same no matter what the object of their venom happens to be.  Kari Simpson is
not a violent person.  I in no way compare her to the violent people in the
past that I spoke of and alluded to.  The trouble is people who don’t want
violence often unwittingly provoke it, and Kari Simpson is thank God permitted
in our society to say exactly what she wishes, but the other side of the free
speech coin is a public decent enough to know a mean-spirited, power mad,
rabble rousing and, yes, dangerous bigot when they see one.  When we come
back we’ll talk to Mike Smyth right after this.   Appeal allowed with costs.  Solicitors for the appellants:  Owen Bird Law Corporation,
