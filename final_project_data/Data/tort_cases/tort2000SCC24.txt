Non-Marine Underwriters, Lloyd’s of London v. Scalera, [2000]
1 S.C.R. 551  Vincent Scalera                                                                                  Appellant  v.  M. J. Oppenheim in his quality as Attorney in Canada for the
Non-Marine Underwriters, members of Lloyd’s of London       Respondent  Indexed as:  Non-Marine
Underwriters, Lloyd’s of London v. Scalera  Neutral citation:  2000 SCC 24.  File No.:  26695.  1999:  October 14; 2000:  May 3.   on appeal from the british columbia court of appeal  Insurance -- Homeowner’s insurance -- Insurer’s
duty to defend -- Plaintiff bringing action against insured alleging battery,
negligent battery, negligent misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty --
Policy containing exclusion for intentional acts of insured -- Whether insurer
has a duty to defend.  Torts -- Intentional torts -- Battery -- Evidence
-- Burden of proof -- Consent -- Whether plaintiff must prove lack of consent. In 1996, a plaintiff brought a civil action against
five B.C. Transit bus drivers, including the appellant, arising out of various
alleged sexual assaults between 1988 and 1992.  The allegations included
battery, negligent battery, negligent misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary
duty.  The appellant owned a homeowner’s insurance policy issued by the
respondent insurer.  The policy provided coverage for “compensatory damage
because of bodily injury” arising from the insured’s personal actions, excepting
“bodily injury or property damage caused by any intentional or criminal act”. 
The British Columbia Supreme Court dismissed the respondent’s request for a
declaration that it not be required to defend the appellant against the
plaintiff’s claims.  The Court of Appeal allowed the respondent’s appeal.  Held:  The appeal should be dismissed.  Per L’Heureux-Dubé,
Gonthier, McLachlin and Binnie JJ.:  The plaintiff’s claims could not trigger
coverage under the policy.  Accordingly, the respondent has no duty to defend. 
While there is substantial agreement with Iacobucci J.’s reasoning, his
approach to the tort of battery in the sexual context is disagreed with.  In
the tort of sexual battery, consent operates as a defence and must be proven by
the defendant.  The plaintiff is not required to prove that the defendant
either knew that she was not consenting or that a reasonable person in the
defendant’s position would have known that she was not consenting.  The traditional rights-based approach to the law of
battery that is now the law of Canada should not be set aside lightly.  The
tort of battery is a form of trespass against the person and is aimed at
protecting the personal autonomy of the individual.  Its purpose is to
recognize the right of each person to control his or her body and who touches
it, and to permit damages where this right is violated.  The compensation stems
not from fault, but from violation of the right to personal autonomy.  When a
person interferes with the body of another, a prima facie case of
violation of the plaintiff’s autonomy is made out.  The law may then fairly
call upon the person thus implicated to explain, or raise some defence, such as
the defence of consent. If he can show that he acted with consent, the prima
facie violation is negated and the plaintiff’s claim will fail.  But it is
not up to the plaintiff to prove that, in addition to directly interfering with
her body, the defendant was also at fault.  Unlike negligence, where the
requirement of fault can be justified because the tortious sequence may be
complicated, trespass to the person is confined to direct interferences.  Where
the trespass causes actual injury to the plaintiff, there is a direct
connection between the defendant’s action and the plaintiff’s injury. The
traditional approach to trespass is also practical, since, if the defendant is
in a position to say what happened, it is both sensible and just to give him an
incentive to do so by putting the burden of explanation on him.  In addition,
the close causal relationship between the defendant’s conduct and the violation
of the plaintiff’s bodily integrity, the identification of the loss with the
plaintiff’s personality and freedom, the infliction of the loss in isolated (as
opposed to systemic) circumstances, and the perception of the defendant’s
conduct as anti-social all support the legal position that once the direct
interference with the plaintiff’s person is shown, the defendant may fairly be
called upon to explain his behaviour if indeed it was innocent.  Therefore, while a plaintiff generally must prove all
elements of the tort she alleges, the fact that contact must be harmful or
offensive to constitute battery does not mean that the plaintiff must prove
that she did not consent and that the defendant actually or constructively knew
she did not consent to sexual contact.  When it is accepted that the foundation
of the tort of battery is a violation of personal autonomy, all contact outside
the exceptional category of contact that is generally accepted or expected in
the course of ordinary life is prima facie offensive.  Since sexual
contact is not generally accepted or expected in the course of ordinary
activities, the plaintiff may establish an action for sexual battery without
negativing actual or constructive consent.  Nothing special about sexual
battery justifies requiring the plaintiff to prove that she did not consent or
that the defendant either knew or ought to have known that she did not consent.  The exclusion clause in the policy must be interpreted
as requiring an intent to injure.  Where there is an allegation of sexual
battery, courts will conclude as a matter of legal inference that the defendant
intended harm for the purpose of construing exemptions of insurance coverage
for intentional injury.  It is unnecessary to comment on the relationship
between battery and negligence.  Per Iacobucci, Major
and Bastarache JJ.:  The respondent has no duty to defend the appellant because
the plaintiff’s statement of claim makes no allegation that could potentially
give rise to indemnity under the insurance contract.  An insurer only has a duty to defend when a lawsuit
against the insured raises a claim that could potentially fall within
coverage.  The insurer’s duty to defend is related to its duty to indemnify. 
Therefore if an insurance policy, like the one in this case, excludes liability
arising from intentionally caused injuries, there will be no duty to defend
actions based on such injuries.  A three-step process must be applied to determine
whether a claim could trigger indemnity.  First, a court should determine which
of the plaintiff’s legal allegations are properly pleaded.  In doing so, courts
are not bound by the legal labels chosen by the plaintiff.  A plaintiff cannot
change an intentional tort into a negligent one simply by choice of words, or
vice versa.  Therefore, when ascertaining the scope of the duty to defend, a
court must look beyond the choice of labels, and examine the substance of the
allegations contained in the pleadings.  This does not involve deciding whether
the claims have any merit; all a court must do is decide, based on the
pleadings, the true nature of the claims.  At the second stage, the court
should determine if any claims are entirely derivative in nature.  The duty to
defend will not be triggered simply because a claim can be cast in terms of
both negligence and intentional tort.  A claim for negligence will not be
derivative if the underlying elements of the negligence and of the intentional
tort are sufficiently disparate to render the two claims unrelated.  However,
if both the negligence and intentional tort claims arise from the same actions
and cause the same harm, the negligence claim is derivative, and it will be
subsumed into the intentional tort for the purposes of the exclusion clause
analysis.  If neither claim is derivative, the claim of negligence will survive
and the duty to defend will apply.  Finally, at the third stage, the court must
decide whether any of the properly pleaded, non-derivative claims could
potentially trigger the insurer’s duty to defend.  This appeal’s holding with
respect to the proper characterization of a plaintiff’s tort allegations should
not be taken to affect any areas of law outside the insurance context presented
by this appeal.   Cases Cited  By McLachlin J.  Referred to:  Collins

G. Madryga, for the appellant.  Eric A. Dolden and Karen
F. W. Liang, for the respondent.  The judgment of L’Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier, McLachlin
and Binnie JJ. was delivered by  1                                  
McLachlin J. --  I have read the reasons of Iacobucci J. and agree with the
result he reaches and with much of his reasoning.  I would respectfully
disagree, however, from the view that in the tort of sexual battery, the onus
rests on the plaintiff to prove that the defendant either knew that she was not
consenting or that a reasonable person in the defendant’s position would have known
that she was not consenting.  2                   
As Goff L.J. (as he then was) stated in Collins v. Wilcock,
[1984] 3 All E.R. 374 (Q.B.), at p. 378, “[t]he fundamental principle, plain
and incontestable, is that every person’s body is inviolate”.  The law of
battery protects this inviolability, and it is for those who violate the
physical integrity of others to justify their actions.  Accordingly, in my
respectful view, the plaintiff who alleges sexual battery makes her case by
tendering evidence of force applied directly to her.  “Force”, in the context
of an allegation of sexual battery, simply refers to physical contact of a
sexual nature, and is neutral in the sense of not necessarily connoting a lack
of consent.  If the defendant does not dispute that the contact took place, he
bears the burden of proving that the plaintiff consented or that a reasonable
person in his position would have thought that she consented.  My reasons for
so concluding are the following.  I.                   
Analysis  A.        The Canadian Law of Battery Places the
Onus of Proving Consent on the       Defendant  3                   
As Iacobucci J. states (at para. 103) “for traditional batteries,
consent is conceived of as an affirmative defence that must be raised by the
defendant”.  4                   
This Court has long affirmed this proposition. In Cook v. Lewis,
[1951] S.C.R. 830, at p. 839, Cartwright J. stated that “where a plaintiff is
injured by force applied directly to him by the defendant his case is made by
proving this fact and the onus falls upon the defendant to prove ‘that such
trespass was utterly without his fault’.”  5                   
In Larin v. Goshen (1974), 56 D.L.R. (3d) 719 (N.S.C.A.),
at p. 722, Macdonald J.A., citing numerous authorities, stated:  “The law in
Canada at present is this: In an action for damages in trespass where the
plaintiff proves that he has been injured by the direct act of the defendant,
the onus falls upon the defendant to prove that his act was both unintentional
and without negligence on his part, in order for him to be entitled to a
dismissal of the action.”  (Emphasis in original.) See also Walmsley v.
Humenick, [1954] 2 D.L.R. 232 (B.C.S.C.); Tillander v. Gosselin (1966),
60 D.L.R. (2d) 18 (Ont. H.C.), aff’d (1967), 61 D.L.R. (2d) 192 (Ont. C.A.);
Dahlberg v. Naydiuk (1969), 10 D.L.R. (3d) 319 (Man. C.A.), and Ellison
v. Rogers (1967), 67 D.L.R. (2d) 21 (Ont. H.C.).  A
number of academic commentators also agree that the burden of proving consent
lies on the defence: see J. G. Fleming,  The Law of Torts (9th ed. 1998), at p.
86; A. M. Linden and L. N. Klar, Canadian Tort Law: Cases, Notes and 
Materials (10th ed. 1994), at p. 102, note 2;  and G. H. L. Fridman, The
Law of Torts in Canada (1989), vol. 1, at p. 63.  6                   
This proposition holds for particular forms of battery like medical
battery and sexual battery.  In Reibl v. Hughes, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 880, at
p. 890, dealing with medical battery, Laskin C.J. stated for the Court that:  The tort [of battery] is an intentional one, consisting of an
unprivileged and unconsented to invasion of one’s bodily security.  True
enough, it has some advantages for a plaintiff over an action of negligence
since it does not require proof of causation and it casts upon the defendant
the burden of proving consent to what was done.    And in Norberg
v. Wynrib, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 226, dealing with sexual battery, La Forest J.,
for the plurality, stated, at p. 246, that “[a] battery is the intentional
infliction of unlawful force on another person.  Consent, express or implied,
is a defence to battery.”  None of the members of the Court
participating in the decision dissented from the view that the burden lies on
the defendant to prove consent.  7                   
The question, then, is whether we should in this case depart from
the settled rule that requires the plaintiff in a battery case to show only
contact through a direct, intentional act of the defendant and places the onus
on the defendant of showing consent or lawful excuse, including actual or
constructive consent.  For the reasons that follow, I am not convinced that we
should alter the established rule.  A.                
The Traditional Approach to Trespass is Justified as a Rights-Based
Tort  8                   
The traditional rule, as noted, is that the plaintiff in an action for
trespass to the person (which includes battery) succeeds if she can prove
direct interference with her person.  Interference is direct if it is the
immediate consequence of a force set in motion by an act of the defendant:  see
Scott v. Shepherd (1773), 2 Black. W. 892, 96 E.R. 525 (K.B.); Leame
v. Bray (1803), 3 East 593, 102 E.R. 724 (K.B.).  The burden is then on the
defendant to allege and prove his defence.  Consent is one such defence.  9                   
Some critics have suggested that this rule should be altered. 
They suggest that tort must always be fault-based.  This means the plaintiff
must prove fault as part of her case, by showing either: (1) that the defendant
intended to harm; (2) that the defendant failed to take reasonable care or was
“negligent”; or (3) that the tort is one of strict liability, i.e. legally
presumed fault.  On a practical level, some, like F. L. Sharp, argue that the
traditional approach confers an unfair advantage on the plaintiff by easing her
burden of proof: “Negligent Trespass in Canada:  A Persistent Source of
Embarrassment” (1977-78), 1 Advocates’ Q. 311, at pp. 312-14 and
326.  It is suggested that the law has moved in this direction in England:  see
Fowler v. Lanning, [1959] 1
Q.B. 426, approved in obiter in Letang v. Cooper, [1965] 1 Q.B.
232 (C.A.).  In the spirit of these comments, my colleague Iacobucci J.
proposes to alter the traditional rule, at least  for sexual battery, to
require the plaintiff to prove fault, i.e. that the defendant either knew or
ought to have known that she was not consenting.  10               
I do not agree with these criticisms of the traditional rule.  In my
view the law of battery is based on protecting individuals’ right to personal
autonomy.  To base the law of battery purely on the principle of fault is to
subordinate the plaintiff’s right to protection from invasions of her physical
integrity to the defendant’s freedom to act: see R. Sullivan, “Trespass to the
Person in Canada: A Defence of the Traditional Approach” (1987), 19 Ottawa
L. Rev. 533, at p. 546.  Although I do not necessarily  accept all of
Sullivan’s contentions, I agree with her characterization, at p. 551, of
trespass to the person as a “violation of the plaintiff’s right to exclusive
control of his person”.   This right is not absolute, because a defendant who
violates this right can nevertheless exonerate himself by proving a lack of
intention or negligence: Cook,  supra, at p. 839, per Cartwright
J.  Although liability in battery is based not on the defendant’s fault, but on
the violation of the plaintiff’s right, the traditional approach will not
impose liability without fault because the violation of another person’s right
can be considered a form of fault.  Basing the law of battery on protecting the
plaintiff’s physical autonomy helps explain why the plaintiff in an action for
battery need prove only a direct interference, at which point the onus shifts
to the person who is alleged to have violated the right to justify the
intrusion, excuse it or raise some other defence.  11               
I agree with Sullivan’s view that the traditional approach to trespass
to the person remains appropriate in Canada’s modern context for a number of
reasons.  First, unlike negligence, where the requirement of fault can be
justified because the tortious sequence may be complicated, trespass to the
person is confined to direct interferences.  Where the trespass causes actual
injury to the plaintiff, there is a direct connection between the defendant’s
action and the plaintiff’s injury.  As Sullivan notes, at p. 562:  . . . where the injury complained of is an immediate consequence of the
defendant’s act, it is intuitively sound to require compensation from the
defendant unless he offers a defence.  In cases of direct interference, the
relationship between the defendant’s will, his decision to act, and the injury
to the plaintiff is both simple and clear; there are no competing causal
factors to obscure the defendant’s role or dilute his factual responsibility. 
The question of his moral and legal responsibility is thus posed with unusual
sharpness:  as between the defendant who caused the injury and the plaintiff
who received it, other things being equal, who shall pay? . . .  Once the plaintiff
has shown that his right to personal autonomy has been violated by the
defendant, prima facie the defendant should pay.  [Emphasis added.]   12               
Another factor supporting retaining the traditional approach to trespass
and  battery is that it makes practical sense.  Linden J. in Bell Canada
v. COPE (Sarnia) Ltd.  (1980), 11 C.C.L.T. 170 (Ont. H.C.), aff’d
(1980), 31 O.R. (2d) 571 (C.A.), after noting the attacks on the Canadian law
of trespass, writes (at p. 180):  The trespass action still performs several
functions, one of its most important being a mechanism for shifting the onus of
proof of whether there has been intentional or negligent wrongdoing to the
defendant, rather than requiring the plaintiff to prove fault.  The trespass
action, though perhaps somewhat anomalous, may thus help to smoke out evidence
possessed by defendants, who cause direct injuries to plaintiffs, which should
assist Courts to obtain a fuller picture of the facts, a most worthwhile
objective. [Emphasis added.]   13               
In cases of direct interference, the defendant is likely to know how and
why the interference occurred.  I agree with Sullivan’s suggestion, at p. 563,
that “if the defendant is in a position to say what happened, it is both
sensible and just to give him an incentive to do so by putting the burden of
explanation on him”.  14               
Finally, I share Sullivan’s concern with the fact that cases of direct
interference with the person tend to produce high “demoralization costs” (p.
563).  Victims and those who identify with them tend to feel resentment and
insecurity if the wrong is not compensated.  The close causal relationship
between the defendant’s conduct and the violation of the plaintiff’s bodily
integrity, the identification of the loss with the plaintiff’s personality and
freedom, the infliction of the loss in isolated (as opposed to systemic) 
circumstances, and the perception of the defendant’s conduct as anti-social,
all support the legal position that once the direct interference with the
plaintiff’s person is shown, the defendant may fairly be called upon to explain
his behaviour if indeed it was innocent.  15               
These arguments persuade me that we should not lightly set aside the
traditional rights-based approach to the law of battery that is now the law of
Canada.  The tort of battery is aimed at protecting the personal autonomy of
the individual.  Its purpose is to recognize the right of each person to control
his or her body and who touches it, and to permit damages where this right is
violated.  The compensation stems  from violation of the right to autonomy, not
fault.  When a person interferes with the body of another, a prima facie
case of violation of the plaintiff’s autonomy is made out.  The law may then
fairly call upon the person thus implicated to explain, if he can.  If he can
show that he acted with consent, the prima facie violation is negated
and the plaintiff’s claim will fail.  But it is not up to the plaintiff to
prove that, in addition to directly interfering with her body, the defendant
was also at fault.  16                     
Having stated that we should not set
aside the traditional approach to battery, I do not wish to foreclose the
possibility of future growth in this area of the law.  References in
definitions of the tort of battery to “injury”, or to contact being “unlawful”
or “harmful or offensive” are different ways of expressing the idea that not
every physical contact constitutes a battery.  In other words, the tort
requires contact “plus” something else.  One view, as I discuss in the next
section, is that the “plus” refers merely to non-trivial contact.  The caselaw
to date tends to support this view, and generally does not require actual
physical or psychological injury: Cole v. Turner (1704), 6 Mod. 149, 87
E.R. 907; Stewart v. Stonehouse, [1926] 2 D.L.R. 683 (Sask. C.A.), at p.
684;  Fleming, supra, at p. 29;
 Fridman, supra, at p. 45.  In a future case, it
may be necessary to consider whether the “plus” required in addition to contact
should be extended beyond the minimum of non-trivial acts.  However, the issue
does not arise in this case, since the plaintiff pleads physical and
psychological damage.  This is sufficient to bring the case within the
traditional view of battery, however the “plus” is defined.  Therefore,
for the purposes of this case, I proceed upon the traditional view.  B.                      
The Argument that the Contact Must Be “Harmful or Offensive”
Does Not Support Placing the Onus of Proving Non-Consent on the Plaintiff  17                     
The proposition that the law should require a plaintiff in an action for
sexual battery to prove that she did not consent, is supported, it is
suggested, by a requirement that the contact involved in battery must be
harmful or offensive.  The argument may be summarized as follows.  The
plaintiff must prove all the essential elements of the tort of battery.  One of
these is that the contact complained of was inherently harmful or offensive on
an objective standard.  Consensual sexual contact is neither harmful nor
offensive.  Therefore the plaintiff, in order to make out her case, must prove
that she did not consent or that a reasonable person in the defendant’s
position would not have thought she consented.  18                     
I do not dispute that a plaintiff generally must prove all elements of
the tort she alleges.  Nor do I dispute that contact must be “harmful or
offensive” to constitute battery.  However, I am not persuaded
that plaintiffs in cases of sexual battery must prove that contact was
“non-consensual” in order to prove that it was “harmful or offensive”.   If
one accepts that the foundation of the tort of battery is a violation of
personal autonomy, it follows that all contact outside the exceptional category
of contact that is generally accepted or expected in the course of ordinary
life, is prima facie offensive.  Sexual contact does not fall into the
category of contact generally accepted or expected in the course of ordinary
activities.  Hence the plaintiff may establish an action for sexual battery
without negativing actual or constructive consent.  19                     
The idea that battery is confined to conduct that is “harmful or
offensive” finds root in the old cases involving trivial contacts.  While the
law of battery traditionally has held that the defendant, not the plaintiff,
bears the onus of proving consent, it has also held that not every trivial
contact suffices to establish battery.  The classic example is being jostled in
a crowd.  A person who enters a crowd cannot sue for being jostled; such
contact is not “offensive”.  Two theories have been put forward to explain this
wrinkle on the general rule that all a plaintiff in a battery action must prove
is direct contact.  The first is implied consent:  Salmond and Heuston on
the Law of Torts (21st ed. 1996), at p. 121.  The second sees these cases
as “a general exception embracing all physical contact which is generally
acceptable in the ordinary conduct of everyday life”:  In re F., [1990]
2 A.C. 1 (H.L.), at p. 73, per Lord Goff.  20                     
Both these theories are consistent with the settled rule in Canadian law
that a plaintiff in a battery action need not prove the absence of consent.  On
the implied consent theory, even if the plaintiff proves contact, the burden
never shifts to the defendant to prove consent because consent is implied by
law.  On the “exception” theory, the plaintiff cannot succeed merely by proving
contact if such contact falls within the exceptional category of conduct generally
acceptable in ordinary life.  It is not necessary in this appeal to choose
between these approaches, but in my view both refer to the sort of everyday
physical contact which one must be expected to tolerate, even if one does not
actually consent to it.  21                     
The question then becomes whether sexual battery falls into the
extraordinary category of cases where proving contact will not suffice to
establish the plaintiff’s case.  Is sexual activity the sort of activity where
consent is implied?  Clearly it is not.  Alternatively, is it the sort of
activity, like being jostled in a crowd, that is generally accepted and
expected as a normal part of life?  Again, I think not.  The sort of conduct
the cases envision is the inevitable contact that goes with ordinary human
activity, like brushing someone’s hand in the course of exchanging a gift, a
gratuitous handshake, or being jostled in a crowd.  Sexual contact does not
fall into this category.  It is not the casual, accidental or inevitable consequence
of general human activity and interaction.  It involves singling out another
person’s body in a deliberate, targeted act.  22                     
The assertion in some of the authorities that the contact must be
harmful or offensive to constitute battery (see, e.g., La Forest J. in M.
(K.) v. M. (H.), [1992] 3 S.C.R. 6, at p. 25), reflects the need to exclude
from battery the casual contacts inevitable in ordinary life.  It does not,
however, require the conclusion that to make out a case of battery, a plaintiff
must prove that the contact was physically or psychologically injurious or
morally offensive.  The law of battery protects the inviolability of the
person.  It starts from the presumption that apart from the usual and
inevitable contacts of ordinary life, each person is entitled not to be
touched, and not to have her person violated.   The sexual touching itself,
absent the defendant showing lawful excuse, constitutes the violation and is
“offensive”.  Sex is not an ordinary casual contact which must be accepted in everyday
life, nor is it the sort of contact to which consent can be implied.  To
require a plaintiff in an action for sexual battery to prove that she did not
consent or that a reasonable person in the defendant’s position would not have
thought she consented, would be to deny the protection the law has
traditionally afforded to the inviolability of the body in the situation where
it is perhaps most needed and appropriate. 23                     
Only two cases, one in England concerning therapeutic administration of
drugs and one in New Zealand concerning sexual assault, are cited in favour of
the proposition that the plaintiff must show harm by proving a lack of consent
as an element of the tort of battery: see Freeman v. Home Office, [1983]
3 All E.R. 589 (Q.B.), aff’d [1984] 1 All E.R. 1036 (C.A.), H. v. R.,
[1996] 1 N.Z.L.R. 299 (H.C.). The proposition that the plaintiff must prove a
lack of consent, on the basis that she must prove that the impugned contact was
harmful, is not supported by the law of battery, which has traditionally been
confined to acts which are inherently harmful, like hitting, shooting or
stabbing someone.   Rather, its focus is on the protection of one’s bodily
integrity from any unwanted contact.  Many of the older cases concern contacts
devoid of any real harm apart from the violation of bodily integrity: Pursell
v. Horn (1838), 8 AD. & E. 602, 112 E.R. 966 (pouring water on a
person); Green v. Goddard (1704), 2 Salkeld 641, 91 E.R. 540 (forcibly
taking an object held by another); Humphries v. Connor (1864), 17 Ir. 
Com. L. Rep. 1 (Q.B.) (taking flower worn by plaintiff), and Forde v.
Skinner (1830), 4 Car. & P. 239, 172 E.R. 687 (cutting a person’s
hair).  In more modern times, the same is true of medical battery cases.  Like
sexual acts, medical interventions may incidentally produce physical and
psychological harm which may go to damages,  but the basic “offence” or  “harm”
upon which the tort rests is the violation of the plaintiff’s bodily
integrity.  As I discuss below, Canadian courts do not require plaintiffs
alleging medical battery to prove that the defendant medical practitioner knew
or ought to have known that the plaintiff did not consent to the medical contact.  24                     
The practical counterpart of the argument that battery must involve
inherently harmful or offensive conduct in some larger sense is the suggestion
that absent such a requirement, plaintiffs will be able to unfairly drag
defendants into court as a result of consensual sex, putting them to the
trouble and risk of proving that the plaintiff consented or that a reasonable
person would have concluded she consented.   This point was not strongly
argued, and with reason.  Few plaintiffs to consensual sex or in situations
where consent is a reasonable inference from the circumstances, are likely to
sue if they are virtually certain to lose when the facts come out.  Moreover,
the rules of court provide sanctions for vexatious litigants.  There is no need
to change the law of battery to avoid vexatious claims.  25                     
Moreover, the prospect of plaintiffs suing and saying nothing about
consent is more theoretical than real.  In fact, plaintiffs suing for sexual
battery usually testify that they did not consent to the sexual contact. 
Failure to do so, absent an explanation, makes it more likely the defendant
could win when he calls evidence of consent or reasonable appearance of
consent.  Even if a plaintiff were to bring an action in sexual battery against
the estate of a deceased defendant, many provincial and territorial evidence
acts would not allow the plaintiff to obtain a judgment against the estate
unless her evidence were corroborated by other material evidence:  see Evidence
Acts of Alberta, R.S.A. 1980, c. A-21, s. 12; Newfoundland, R.S.N. 1990, c.
E-16, s. 16; Northwest Territories, R.S.N.W.T. 1988, c. E-8, s. 17; Nova
Scotia, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 154, s. 45; Ontario, R.S.O. 1990, c. E.23, s.
13; Prince Edward Island, R.S.P.E.I. 1988, c. E-11, s. 11; Yukon, R.S.Y. 1986,
c. 57, s. 14.  At the same time, as discussed more fully below, placing on the
plaintiff the legal burden of always negativing actual and constructive
consent on pain of non-suit, may lead to injustice.  26                     
I conclude that the fact that the law of battery excludes trivial
contact and requires contact that is “harmful or offensive” does not require us
to conclude that the plaintiff bears the burden of proving that the defendant
actually or constructively knew she did not consent to sexual contact.  D.           There Is Nothing Particular About
Sexual Assault that Makes it Necessary to Have a Special Rule of Battery for
Sexual Assaults for What the Plaintiff Must Prove  27                     
If there were something special about sexual battery that justified requiring
the plaintiff to prove that the defendant either knew she was not consenting or
ought to have known that she was not consenting, a case might be made for so
doing.  The result would be a special rule for sexual battery inconsistent with
the law of battery generally, and the creation of a new tort of sexual
battery.  Thus far the courts have declined to do this.  As Professor
Feldthusen notes, “[t]here has yet to be recognised a new nominate tort of sexual
battery” (emphasis in original):  “The Canadian Experiment with the Civil
Action for Sexual Battery”, in N. J. Mullany, ed., Torts in the Nineties
(1997), 274, at p. 281.  The sexual aspects of the claim go only to damages.  
However, as I stated above,  a new tort of sexual battery with different rules
from ordinary battery could be recognized in an appropriate case.  28                     
Before examining whether sexual battery is so different that special
rules are required as to what the plaintiff must show, it is important to take
note of the danger of placing special, unjustified burdens on victims of sexual
encounters.  At p. 282, Feldthusen notes that “in the criminal sphere,
enquiries into alleged consent have allowed the focus of the criminal trial to
shift from the actions of the defendant to the character of the complainant.  The
same potential exists in tort law” (emphasis added).  As he points out,
“[t]here exist in our law deeply imbedded tendencies towards victim blaming”
(p. 283).  This is not to say that alleged victims of sexual assault could
never be singled out by placing special rules of proof on them that do not
apply to other types of plaintiffs.  It is rather to say that we must guard
against placing such burdens upon alleged victims of sexual assault unless it
can objectively be shown that it is necessary to do so in order to achieve
justice.  29                     
To require plaintiffs in actions for sexual battery to prove that they
did not consent and that a reasonable person in the circumstances of the
defendant would not have believed they consented, is to place a burden on
plaintiffs in actions for sexual battery that plaintiffs in other types of
battery do not bear.  It is to do so, moreover, in the absence of any
compelling reason.  Indeed, there are powerful reasons for applying the usual
rules that require a plaintiff to prove only direct contact in cases of sexual
battery.  30                     
The first concern is that by requiring the plaintiff to prove more than
the traditional battery claim requires, we inappropriately shift the focus of
the trial from the defendant’s behaviour to the plaintiff’s character. 
Requiring the plaintiff to prove that a reasonable person in the position of
the defendant would have known that she was not consenting requires her to
justify her actions.  In practical terms, she must prove that she made it clear
through her conduct and words that she did not consent to the sexual contact. 
Her conduct, not the defendant’s, becomes the primary focus from the outset. 
If she cannot prove these things, she will be non-suited and the defendant need
never give his side of the story.  31                     
The proposed shift to the plaintiff of the onus of disproving
constructive consent runs the risk of victim blaming, against which Feldthusen
and others properly warn.  It also runs the risk of making it impossible for
deserving victims of sexual battery to even get their foot in the litigation
door.  Consider the case of the victim of sexual assault who cannot testify to
the events because of shock, loss of memory or inebriation.  If she can prove
that she was sexually assaulted and identify the perpetrator through
third-person evidence, should she be non-suited at the outset because she
cannot prove that her conduct in the circumstances would have led a reasonable
person to conclude she was not consenting?  Is it not better in such cases that
the defendant be called upon to give evidence so the court can decide the case
on a more complete picture of the facts?  This is what the law of battery would
traditionally require. Why should we exempt the defendant because the battery
is a sexual battery?  32                     
The proposed shift of onus runs counter to Parliament’s expressed view
in the criminal context.  Although the aims of criminal law and the law of tort
are not identical, it remains significant that Parliament in s. 273.2 (b)
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , stipulates that those
accused of sexual assault who seek to invoke the defence of honest but mistaken
belief in consent must have taken reasonable steps in the circumstances known
to them at the time to ascertain the complainant’s consent.  Parliament has
thus moved to counteract the historic tendency of criminal trials for sexual
assault to focus unduly on the behaviour of the complainant, and to redirect
some of the focus to the defendant.  The traditional tort of battery already
provides this focus in the civil domain.  That focus should be retained in my
view.  To quote Sullivan, supra, at p. 563, “if the defendant is in a
position to say what happened, it is both sensible and just to give him an incentive
to do so by putting the burden of explanation on him”.  33                     
Requiring the plaintiff to disprove constructive consent seems all the
more unfair because the relevant facts lie first and foremost within the
defendant’s sphere of knowledge.  He alone knows whether he actually believed
the plaintiff was consenting,  and if he believed she was consenting, he is in
the best position to give evidence on the factors that led him to believe
that.  The plaintiff, by contrast, is not in a position to produce evidence of
what was in the defendant’s mind nor in as good a position to say what factors
led him to that state of mind and whether he acted reasonably.  While the
defendant’s particular knowledge about his state of mind regarding consent is
not determinative of who bears the burden of proof regarding consent, it is one
of the principles of fairness and policy that are said to influence the
allocation of this burden: see J. Sopinka, S. N. Lederman, and A. W. Bryant, The
Law of Evidence in Canada (2nd ed. 1999), at § 3.70; McCormick on
Evidence (5th ed. 1999), vol. 2, at § 337.  34                     
I conclude that there is nothing about sexual battery that requires that
the traditional rules of onus governing battery actions be changed.  On the
contrary, placing the onus on the plaintiff of disproving consent and
constructive consent seems unfairly to impose special obligations on plaintiffs
who sue for sexual assault.  E.            To
Require the Plaintiff to Prove that the Defendant Knew or Ought to Have      Known
She Was Not Consenting Presents the Dilemma of Either Changing                      the
Law for Other Types of Battery or Introducing an Inconsistency in the      Law
of Battery  35                     
To hold that battery must involve a contact that is inherently harmful
or offensive has the potential to change the law relating to other types of
battery, like medical battery.  Alternatively, if it does not, it will
introduce an inconsistency into the law of battery.  36                     
As discussed, Canadian courts have repeatedly held that for medical
battery, the defendant bears the onus of proving consent as a defence: see, for
example, Reibl, supra; Schweizer v. Central Hospital
(1974), 53 D.L.R. (3d) 494 (Ont. H.C.); Allan v. New Mount Sinai Hospital
(1980), 109 D.L.R. (3d) 634 (Ont. H.C.), rev’d on other grounds (1981), 33 O.R.
(2d) 603 (C.A.); Brushett v. Cowan (1990), 3 C.C.L.T. (2d)
195 (Nfld. C.A.), at p. 199,  and O’Bonsawin v. Paradis (1993), 15
C.C.L.T. (2d) 188 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)).  Like sexual contact, the act of
medical intervention is not inherently harmful or offensive, beyond its
potential to violate bodily integrity.  If sexual battery requires the
plaintiff to prove that the defendant knew or ought to have known that the
plaintiff did not consent, it is difficult to see why the same would not hold
for medical malpractice.  Yet no one has suggested that the law of medical
malpractice ought to be changed to place an additional burden on the plaintiff
of proving a culpable state of mind in the defendant medical practitioner.  The
alternative, if the law of battery were changed in this regard for sexual
battery, would be inconsistency in the law of battery.  Neither alternative is
attractive.  This suggests a further reason for being wary of the proposition
that battery requires proof by the plaintiff of an inherently harmful or
offensive act.  F.                       
Requiring the Plaintiff to Prove that the Defendant Knew or Ought to
Have Known that She Did Not Consent is Neither Necessary nor Sufficient to
Permit the Conclusion that the Insurers in this Case Are Not Obligated to Defend
the Defendant  37                     
The question at issue on this appeal is whether the insurer may avoid
the obligation to defend the defendant to the battery action under the policy
exclusion for “any intentional . . . act”.  I agree with Iacobucci J. that this
clause must be interpreted as requiring an intent to injure.  It follows that
for the tort of sexual battery to be excluded from policy coverage, it must
always involve intent to injure.  38                     
As I understand his reasons, Iacobucci J. finds this intent to injure is
present on the basis of legal inference, not as a matter of fact. The law presumes
that in actions of battery for sexual assault, the defendant intends to injure
the plaintiff.  Thus Iacobucci J. states “[g]iven . . . actual or constructive
knowledge of non-consent, the law will not permit the appellant to claim
that he did not intend any harm” (para. 94 (emphasis added)).  This legal
inference is necessary because in cases of constructive knowledge, the
defendant may be held liable despite the fact that he had no actual knowledge
of lack of consent and hence  no actual intent to harm the plaintiff. 
Iacobucci J. elaborates at para. 121 in reviewing the American jurisprudence on
this issue, in the context of sexual assaults on children:  Courts have had little difficulty in concluding that defendants in
these cases are presumed to intend harm to their victims – 
notwithstanding the fact that “males who are involved in such activities do not
expect or intend that the females will sustain any injury”. . . . [Emphasis
added.]   In other
words, where there is an allegation of sexual battery, courts will conclude as
a matter of legal inference that the defendant intended harm for the purpose of
construing exemptions of insurance coverage for intentional injury.  39                     
This presumption of intent to harm does not depend on requiring the
plaintiff to prove that the defendant knew or ought to have known that the
plaintiff was not consenting to the sexual contact.  Rather, the presumption
flows from the allegation in the pleadings of battery of a sexual nature. 
American cases, like State Farm Fire and Casualty Co. v. Williams, 355
N.W.2d 421 (Minn. 1984), do not turn on the plaintiff’s bearing the burden of
showing the defendant either knew or ought to have known she did not consent. 
The logic is simply that either the act must have been consensual or not
consensual.  If it was not consensual, the policy does not apply because
neither the insured nor the insurer contemplated coverage for non-consensual
sexual activities.  If it was consensual, then there is no battery and no claim
for recovery.  In either case, the policy does not apply.  As stated in Williams,
at p. 424:   Does the fact that Williams, the victim, was an adult distinguish this
case?  We think not.  Neither the insured nor the insurer in entering into the
insurance contract contemplated coverage against sexual claims arising out of
non-consensual sexual assaults.    40                     
This reasoning applies equally to allegations of negligent sexual
battery where the alleged negligence relates to the defendant’s belief in the
plaintiff’s consent to sexual contact.  For these reasons I conclude that it is
not necessary to place on the plaintiff the burden of proving the defendant’s
knowledge or constructive knowledge of the plaintiff’s non-consent.  41                     
If this reasoning is correct, then placing the non-traditional burden of
disproving consent or constructive consent on the plaintiff is neither a
necessary nor a sufficient condition of concluding that the policy does not
apply in cases like this. Regardless of how one views the matter of onus, the
result will be the same.  G.           Negligent
Battery  42                     
It is unnecessary on this appeal to comment on the relationship between
battery (traditionally thought of mainly as an intentional tort) and
negligence. In this case, insofar as one could speak of negligent battery, it
would be to recognize the defence of reasonable belief in consent to a suit
based on an intentional act.  As discussed, the law in these circumstances
presumes an intention to injure, taking it out of the realm of pure negligence
and bringing it within the ambit of the exclusion clause.  II.            Conclusion  43                     
I conclude that there is no justification in cases of battery of a
sexual nature for departing from the traditional rule that the plaintiff in a
battery action must prove direct contact, at which point the onus shifts to the
defendant to prove consent.  To do so would be to place a burden upon
plaintiffs in battery actions of a sexual nature which plaintiffs in other
battery actions do not bear.  I see neither the need nor the justification for
doing this on the material before us in this case.  44                     
This said, I agree fully with Iacobucci J. that the law will not permit
a defendant in an action for sexual battery to say that though he might be
found to have committed the battery, he did not intend any harm.  This leaves
the defendant with two alternatives discussed in Williams, supra. 
Either the plaintiff consented, in which case no action lies, or she did not
consent and the defendant is deemed to have intended to injure her.  In neither
case does the policy provide coverage.  45                     
Like Iacobucci J., I would dismiss the appeal
with costs.  The reasons of Iacobucci, Major and Bastarache JJ.
were delivered by  IACOBUCCI J.--  I.  Introduction and Overview  46                     
This appeal raises the novel question of whether an insurance company
has a duty to defend the holder of a homeowner’s insurance policy against a
civil sexual assault suit.  In answering this question, we must also address
the role of consent in an action for sexual assault.  47                     
It should be noted that this appeal was heard along with the appeal in Sansalone
v. Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Co., [2000] 1 S.C.R. 627, 2000 SCC 25, reasons
in which are being released concurrently.   49                     
An insurance company’s duty to defend is related to its duty to
indemnify.  A homeowner’s insurance policy entitles the holder to have the
insurer indemnify any liability falling within the policy’s terms.  Since the
insurance company will be paying these costs, it has also developed the right
-- now a duty -- to conduct the defence of such claims.  However, the duty to
defend is not so great that it is presumed to be independent of the duty to
indemnify.  Absent express language to the contrary, the duty to defend extends
only to claims that could potentially trigger indemnity under the policy. 
Therefore if an insurance policy, like the one in this case, excludes liability
arising from intentionally caused injuries, there will be no duty to defend
intentional torts.  50              
Determining whether or not a given claim could trigger indemnity is a three-step
process.  First, a court should determine which of the plaintiff’s legal
allegations are properly pleaded.  In doing so, courts are not bound by the
legal labels chosen by the plaintiff.  A plaintiff cannot change an intentional
tort into a negligent one simply by choice of words, or vice versa.  Therefore,
when ascertaining the scope of the duty to defend, a court must look beyond the
choice of labels, and examine the substance of the allegations contained in the
pleadings.  This does not involve deciding whether the claims have any merit;
all a court must do is decide, based on the pleadings, the true nature of the
claims.  51                     
At the second stage, having determined what claims are properly pleaded,
the court should determine if any claims are entirely derivative in nature. 
The duty to defend will not be triggered simply because a claim can be cast in
terms of both negligence and intentional tort.  If the alleged negligence is
based on the same harm as the intentional tort, it will not allow the insured
to avoid the exclusion clause for intentionally caused injuries.  52                     
Finally, at the third stage the court must decide whether any of the
properly pleaded, non-derivative claims could potentially trigger the insurer’s
duty to defend.  In this appeal, I conclude that the respondent has no duty to
defend.  The plaintiff has alleged three basic claims against the appellant:
sexual battery, negligence, and breach of fiduciary duty.  53                     
To prove a claim for sexual battery, the plaintiff will have to
establish that the defendant intentionally inflicted a harmful or offensive
touching on her.  In the context of sexual battery, “harmful or offensive” is
equivalent to non-consensual.  This test is objective: to establish sexual
battery, the plaintiff must demonstrate that a reasonable person would have
known that the plaintiff did not validly consent to sexual relations.  To put
it another way, the plaintiff will have to prove that the defendant should have
known that she did not validly consent.  It is important to note that, absent
any evidence from the defendant, a simple allegation of non-consensual sex will
suffice to meet this initial burden.  If the plaintiff succeeds, then the
defendant must also be presumed to have intended to injure the plaintiff, given
the inherently harmful nature of non-consensual sexual activity.  The same
facts that prove the sexual battery also necessarily prove an intent to injure,
and therefore the exclusion clause should apply.  If, on the other hand, the
plaintiff cannot establish non-consent, then the plaintiff’s action would have
no chance of success, there would be no possibility of a claim for indemnity,
and the duty to defend would not arise.  54                     
The claims for negligence and breach of fiduciary duty fail to trigger
the duty to defend not because they could not fall within coverage, but because
they are either not properly pleaded, or derivative of the claim for sexual
battery.  As a result, they are also covered by the exclusion for injuries
intentionally caused.  55                     
As there are no properly pleaded claims that, even if successful, could
potentially trigger indemnity, the respondent has no duty to defend, and I
would therefore dismiss the appeal.  II.  Facts  56                     
The underlying action in this appeal is based on a series of alleged
sexual assaults committed against a young girl (“the plaintiff”), who was born
in 1974 and was an adolescent at the time of the incidents in question.  The
plaintiff worked part-time at a grocery store owned and operated by her
parents, located near the terminus of two B.C. Transit bus routes.  In 1996,
the plaintiff brought a civil action against five B.C. Transit bus drivers,
including the appellant, alleging various sexual assaults between 1988 and
1992.  The liability insurance policy owned by one of the bus drivers, Vincent
Scalera, is at issue in this appeal.  57                     
The plaintiff’s statement of claim alleges that between 1986 and 1992,
while on duty with B.C. Transit, the appellant regularly attended the store
belonging to the plaintiff’s parents, and became acquainted with the
plaintiff.  She, in turn, regularly rode on buses driven by the appellant.  The
statement of claim further alleges as follows:  103. On one occasion between approximately January and June of 1991
Scalera committed various sexual acts upon [the plaintiff], including:  (a)                                                                              sexual
kissing;  (b)       sexual touching of her neck, back,
breasts, and genitals; and  (c)                                                                              fellatio  together (the “Scalera sexual acts”).  104. Scalera committed the Scalera sexual acts upon [the plaintiff] in
various locations, including:  (a)                                                                              on
buses owned by B.C. Transit; and  (b)       in his truck.  105. The Scalera sexual acts were committed upon [the plaintiff] by
Scalera for a sexual purpose and/or without [the plaintiff]’s consent.  106. Scalera committed the Scalera sexual acts upon [the plaintiff] by
coercion, manipulation, and abuse of power.  107. The Scalera sexual acts were sexual assaults and/or sexual
exploitation and/or unlawful.  108. At all material times, Scalera was an adult and [the plaintiff]
was an infant and/or a young person.  109. Scalera, by words or conduct, threatened that harm would come to
[the plaintiff] if she disclosed the Scalera sexual acts to another person,
intending to persuade [the plaintiff] to submit to the Scalera sexual acts.  110. Scalera, by words or conduct, knowingly, fraudulently, and
deceitfully misrepresented the Scalera sexual acts committed by him upon [the
plaintiff] as:  (a)                                                                              the
prerogative of an adult;  (b)       consensual activity; and/or  (c)                                                                              a
healthy, normal expression of his affection for her  together (the “Scalera Representations”).  111. Scalera made the Scalera Representations intending to persuade
[the plaintiff] to submit to the Scalera sexual acts.  112. The Scalera Representations were untrue.  113. [The plaintiff] relied on the Scalera Representations concerning
the nature of the Scalera sexual acts and thereby submitted to the Scalera
sexual acts.  114. [The plaintiff] relied on the Scalera Representations concerning
the nature of the Scalera sexual acts and thereby failed to report Scalera’s
conduct to other adults.  115. Scalera knew or ought to have known that the Scalera sexual acts
were unlawful and/or the Scalera Representations were untrue.  116. Scalera knew or ought to have known that [the plaintiff] was an
infant and/or a young person.  117. Scalera knew or ought to have known that [the plaintiff] did not
consent to the Scalera sexual acts.  118. Scalera owed a duty of care to [the plaintiff], which duty of care
arose from the relationship of authority and trust between himself as an adult
and/or bus driver and [the plaintiff] as an infant and/or young person and/or
bus passenger, and Scalera breached this duty of care.  119. Scalera owed a fiduciary duty to [the plaintiff], which fiduciary
duty arose from the relationship of authority and trust between himself as an
adult and/or bus driver and [the plaintiff] as an infant and/or young person
and/or bus passenger, and Scalera breached this fiduciary duty.  120. Scalera committed the Scalera sexual acts willfully and without
lawful justification.  121. The Scalera sexual acts were committed intentionally and/or with
reckless disregard as to their effect on [the plaintiff].  122. By reason of Scalera’s actions in committing the Scalera sexual
acts [the plaintiff] has suffered nervous shock and sustained severe
personal injuries, particulars of which are set out in paragraph 127 below.                                                                      .
. .  128. As a result of the aforesaid sexual assaults, sexual exploitation,
intentional infliction of nervous shock, misrepresentations, negligence,
breaches of duty, and breaches of fiduciary duty committed by . . .  Scalera,
and/or B.C. Transit [the plaintiff] has suffered a loss of income and a loss of
ability to earn income in the future.  129.  As a result of the aforesaid sexual assaults, sexual
exploitation, intentional infliction of nervous shock, misrepresentations,
negligence, breaches of duty, and breaches of fiduciary duty committed by . . .
Scalera, and/or B.C. Transit [the plaintiff] has and/or will continue to incur
expenses, including obtaining proper psychiatric and psychological counselling
and treatment which will be required on both an ongoing and crisis basis.   58                     
In response to a demand for particulars, counsel for the plaintiff
stated that the coercion, manipulation, and abuse of power alleged in para. 106
of the statement of claim consisted of:  (a) pressure to engage in the sexual acts as a result of Scalera’s position
as an adult and [the plaintiff]’s position as an infant and/or young person;  (b) pressure to engage in the sexual acts in order to demonstrate
affection to Scalera;  (c) pressure to engage in the sexual acts in order to secure and/or maintain
Scalera’s alleged affection and/or friendship;  (d) pressure to engage in the sexual acts in order to overcome personal
loneliness and/or insecurity;  (e) pressure to engage in the sexual acts in order to demonstrate
maturity.   59         
The appellant owned a homeowner’s insurance policy issued by the
respondent.  The relevant provisions of that policy are as follows:  SECTION TWO –  PERSONAL LIABILITY INSURANCE                                                                .
. .  This insurance applies only to accidents or occurrences which take
place during the period of insurance indicated on the Declarations.                                                               .
. .  We will pay all sums which you become legally liable to pay as
compensatory damage because of bodily injury or property damage.                                                               .
. .  You are insured for claims made against you arising from:  1.        Personal Liability -- legal liability
arising out of your personal actions anywhere in the world.                                                               .
. .  We will defend, by counsel of our choice, any suit against you alleging
bodily injury or property damage and seeking compensatory damages, even if it
is groundless, false or fraudulent.  We reserve the right to investigate,
negotiate and settle any claim or suit if we decide this is appropriate.                                                                .
. .  GENERAL EXCLUSIONS APPLICABLE TO THIS SECTION TWO  You are not insured for claims arising from:                                                                .
. .  (5)       bodily injury or property damage caused
by any intentional or criminal act or failure to act by:  (a)  any person insured by this document . . .  60                     
The respondent sought a declaration that it not be required to defend
the appellant against the plaintiff’s claims.  Humphries J. dismissed the
respondent’s petition, but the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal.  III.  Judicial
Decisions  A.  British
Columbia Supreme Court (1997), 47 B.C.L.R. (3d) 187  61                     
Humphries J. interpreted the insurance policy’s exclusion such that only
intentional acts, but not intentional injuries, trigger exclusion.  However,
she believed that the relevant act underlying the plaintiff’s claim must be
sexual assault, not merely sexual contact, for it to fall within the
exclusion.  Relying on Co-operative Fire & Casualty Co. v. Saindon,
[1976] 1 S.C.R. 735, she found at para. 23 that “[i]f the allegations in the
Statement of Claim include a possible claim in negligence against [the
appellant], and if such a plea is a legitimate one made in good faith, [the
respondent] cannot rely on the exclusion clause because injury or damage caused
by a negligent act falls outside it”.  Since it was possible that the appellant
had intended only sexual contact, but was simply negligent regarding sexual
assault, there was a duty to defend.  B.  British
Columbia Court of Appeal (1998), 48 B.C.L.R. (3d) 143  (i)        Hollinrake J.A., Proudfoot J.A.
concurring  62                     
The appeals of the respondent and Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Co.,
respondent in the companion appeal, Sansalone, were consolidated at the
Court of Appeal.  Having accepted Saindon as the leading case on point,
Hollinrake J.A. turned to the specific issues raised by the Scalera
appeal.  He concluded that the exclusion clause in question barred claims based
on intentional acts.  Since most tort claims allege negligence and not intent
to injure, excluding intentional acts from coverage was “in keeping with
coverage historically provided by policies insuring against liability imposed
by law caused by accident” (para. 91).  It was also consistent with the
reasonable expectations of the parties.  63                     
Hollinrake J.A. found that the claim advanced sounded in intentional
tort, and saw no reason to require the respondent to prove the intent to
injure.  The appellant’s act was clearly intentional and was within the
exclusion clause, so there was no possibility of coverage.  Any claims based on
the power-dependency relationship between the plaintiff and the appellant also
fell within the exclusion, as it had in Sansalone.  Finally, Hollinrake
J.A. disagreed with Finch J.A. as to the meaning of the duty to defend clause. 
He concluded that, in order for there to be a duty to defend, there had to be
at least a possibility of coverage.  Since he had already determined that there
was no possibility of coverage, he allowed the appeal.  (ii)       Finch J.A., dissenting  64                     
Finch J.A. concluded that in spite of the exclusion clause’s language
referring only to intentional acts, it must be read to exclude liability only
for injury or damage caused intentionally.  To do otherwise would exclude the
vast majority of all claims, since most accidents or occurrences can be traced
back to an intentional act.  Finch J.A. did not read the pleadings as alleging
an intention on the part of the appellant to cause the plaintiff injury.  He
therefore concluded that the duty to defend should apply.  65                     
Moreover, Finch J.A. held that under the wording of the appellant’s
policy, the duty to defend was not linked to the duty to indemnify.  As a
result, the respondent was obliged to defend any claim for bodily injury
causing compensable damages, regardless of whether that claim could also
trigger indemnity.  IV.  Issues  66                     
This appeal raises four issues.  1.        Is the duty to defend in the appellant’s
insurance policy linked to the duty to indemnify?  2.        Do the intentional act exclusion clauses
in the appellant’s insurance policy operate to relieve the respondent’s duty in
this case?  3.        Was there an “accident” or “occurrence”
that is sufficient to trigger coverage?  4.        Does s. 28 of the British Columbia
Insurance Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 226, absolve the respondent of any duty to
defend the appellant?   Because of my
disposition of the first two issues, I find it unnecessary to address the
latter two in this appeal.  V.  Analysis  A.  General
Principles of Insurance Contract Interpretation  67                     
To begin with, I should like to discuss briefly several principles that
are relevant to the interpretation of the insurance policy in question.  While
these principles are merely interpretive aids that cannot decide any issues by
themselves, they are nonetheless helpful when interpreting provisions of an
insurance contract.  (i)        The General Purpose of Insurance  68                     
It is important to keep in mind the underlying economic rationale for
insurance.  C. Brown and J. Menezes, Insurance Law in Canada (2nd ed.
1991), state this point well at pp. 125-26:  Insurance is a mechanism for transferring
fortuitous contingent risks.  Losses that are neither fortuitous nor contingent
cannot economically be transferred because the premium would have to be greater
than the value of the subject matter in order to provide for marketing and
adjusting costs and a profit for the insurer.  It follows, therefore, that even
where the literal working of a policy might appear to cover certain losses, it
does not, in fact, do so if (1) the loss is from the inherent nature of the
subject matter being insured, or (2) it results from the intentional actions of
the insured.   69                     
In other words, insurance usually makes economic sense only where the
losses covered are unforeseen or accidental: “The assumptions on which
insurance is based are undermined if successful claims arise out of loss which
is not fortuitous” (C. Brown, Insurance Law in Canada (3rd ed. 1997), at
p. 4).  This economic rationale takes on a public policy flavour where, as
here, the acts for which the insured is seeking coverage are socially harmful. 
It may be undesirable to encourage people to injure others intentionally by
indemnifying them from the civil consequences.  On the other hand, denying
coverage has the undesirable effect of precluding recovery against a
judgment-proof defendant, thus perhaps discouraging sexual assault victims from
bringing claims.  See B. Feldthusen, “The Civil Action for Sexual Battery:
Therapeutic Jurisprudence?” (1993), 25 Ottawa L. Rev. 203, at p. 233.  (ii)       Contra Proferentem  70                     
Since insurance contracts are essentially adhesionary, the standard
practice is to construe ambiguities against the insurer: Brissette Estate v.
Westbury Life Insurance Co., [1992] 3 S.C.R. 87, at p. 92; Wigle v.
Allstate Insurance Co. of Canada (1984), 49 O.R. (2d) 101 (C.A.), per Cory
J.A.  A corollary of this principle is that “coverage provisions should be
construed broadly and exclusion clauses narrowly”: Reid Crowther &
Partners Ltd. v. Simcoe & Erie General Insurance Co., [1993] 1 S.C.R.
252, at p. 269; Indemnity Insurance Co. of North America v. Excel Cleaning
Service, [1954] S.C.R. 169, at pp. 179-80, per Estey J.  Therefore
one must always be alert to the unequal bargaining power at work in insurance
contracts, and interpret such policies accordingly.  (iii)       Reasonable Expectations  71                     
Where a contract is unambiguous, a court should give effect to the clear
language, reading the contract as a whole: Brissette Estate, supra,
at p. 92; Parsons v. Standard Fire Insurance Co. (1880), 5 S.C.R. 233. 
Where there is ambiguity, this Court has noted “the desirability . . . of
giving effect to the reasonable expectations of the parties”: Reid Crowther,
supra, at p. 269 (citing Brown and Menezes, supra, at pp. 123-31,
and Brissette Estate, supra).  See also Scott v. Wawanesa
Mutual Insurance Co., [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1445, at p. 1467; Wigle, supra. 
Estey J. stated the point succinctly in Consolidated-Bathurst Export Ltd. v.
Mutual Boiler and Machinery Insurance Co., [1980] 1 S.C.R. 888, at pp.
901-2:  [L]iteral meaning should not be applied where to do so would bring
about an unrealistic result or a result which would not be contemplated in the
commercial atmosphere in which the insurance was contracted.  Where words may
bear two constructions, the more reasonable one, that which produces a fair result,
must certainly be taken as the interpretation which would promote the intention
of the parties.  Similarly, an interpretation which defeats the intentions of
the parties and their objective in entering into the commercial transaction in
the first place should be discarded in favour of an interpretation of the
policy which promotes a sensible commercial result. . . .  Said another way,
the courts should be loath to support a construction which would either enable
the insurer to pocket the premium without risk or the insured to achieve a
recovery which could neither be sensibly sought nor anticipated at the time of
the contract.  This court
recently re-stated the importance of commercial reality, in another context, in
Guarantee Co. of North America v. Gordon Capital Corp., [1999] 3 S.C.R.
423, at para. 62.  72                     
With these principles in mind, I now wish to discuss the principal
issues in this appeal.  B.  The
Scope of the Insurer’s Duty to Defend  (i)        The Linkage Between the Duties to
Indemnify and to Defend  73                     
The appellant’s first argument is that the duty to defend is independent
of the duty to indemnify.  The relevant clause in the appellant’s policy
states: “We will defend, by counsel of our choice, any suit against you
alleging bodily injury or property damage and seeking compensatory damages,
even if it is groundless, false or fraudulent.”  The appellant argues, and
Finch J.A. agreed in dissent at the Court of Appeal, that this requires not a
potentially indemnifiable claim, but only a claim alleging bodily injury and
seeking compensatory damages.  74                     
With respect, I cannot agree.  McLachlin J. addressed this question in Nichols
v. American Home Assurance Co., [1990] 1 S.C.R. 801.  The policy in that
appeal specifically limited the duty to defend to suits “seeking damages which
are or may be payable under the terms of this Policy” (p. 805), and so there
was obviously no independent duty to defend under that particular policy. 
However, McLachlin J. went on, at pp. 810-11, to set out general principles
governing the duty to defend, regardless of whether there is express language
or not:  Thus far, I have proceeded only by reference to the
actual wording of the policy.  However, general principles relating to the
construction of insurance contracts support the conclusion that the duty to
defend arises only where the pleadings raise claims which would be payable
under the agreement to indemnify in the insurance contract.  Courts have
frequently stated that “[t]he pleadings govern the duty to defend”: Bacon v.
McBride (1984), 6 D.L.R. (4th) 96 (B.C.S.C.), at p. 99.  Where it is clear
from the pleadings that the suit falls outside of the coverage of the policy by
reason of an exclusion clause, the duty to defend has been held not to arise: Opron
Maritimes Construction Ltd. v. Canadian Indemnity Co. (1986), 19 C.C.L.I.
168 (N.B.C.A.), leave to appeal refused by this Court, [1987] 1 S.C.R. xi.  At the same time, it is not necessary to prove that
the obligation to indemnify will in fact arise in order to trigger the duty to
defend.  The mere possibility that a claim within the policy may succeed suffices. 
In this sense, as noted earlier, the duty to defend is broader than the duty to
indemnify.  .
. .  Other Canadian authority overwhelmingly supports
the view that normally the duty to defend arises only with respect to claims
which, if proven, would fall within the scope of coverage provided by the
policy. . . .  The same view generally prevails in the United States. . . .   75                     
McLachlin J. also provided two policy reasons in support of this
conclusion, and in so doing refuted the contrary arguments made in the American
case Conner v. Transamerica Insurance Co., 496 P.2d 770 (Okla. 1972). 
First, the insurer would have to pay defence costs for claims outside the
policy’s scope.  This raised “policy questions of whether others in the insurance
pool should be taxed with providing defences for matters outside the purview of
the policy”: Nichols, supra, at pp. 811-12.  Second, an
independent duty to defend raises conflict of interest problems.  If the
insurer is defending claims for which it owes no duty to indemnify, there is a
strong incentive simply to settle the claim as quickly as possible.  At the
very least, the insurer has an incentive to try to prove only that the insured
is liable for claims falling outside coverage.  There would be little incentive
to establish that the insured was entirely without blame.  McLachlin J.
therefore concluded, at p. 812, that  considerations relat[ing] to insurance law and practice, as well as the
authorities, overwhelmingly support the view that the duty to defend should,
unless the contract of insurance indicates otherwise, be confined to the
defence of claims which may be argued to fall under the policy.  That said, the
widest latitude should be given to the allegations in the pleadings in
determining whether they raise a claim within the policy.   76                     
While this is obiter dictum, I find McLachlin J.’s arguments
compelling.  Absent specific language to the contrary, the duty to defend is
broader than the duty to indemnify only in so far as it extends to groundless,
false, or fraudulent claims.  Given the historical evolution of the duty to
defend as a way for insurers to protect their interests when they will be
forced to pay any resulting judgment (see J. M. Fischer, “Broadening the
Insurer’s Duty to Defend: How Gray v. Zurich Insurance Co. Transformed
Liability Insurance Into Litigation Insurance” (1991), 25 U.C. Davis L. Rev.
141, at pp. 146-57; E. S. Pryor, “The Tort Liability Regime and the Duty to
Defend” (1999), 58 Md. L. Rev. 1), it makes little sense to presume an
independent duty to defend absent express language:  see B. Vail, “‘My Mistake,
Your Problem’: The Duty to Defend Liability Claims in Canada” (1996), 6 C.I.L.R.
201, at p. 207, and Fischer, supra.  To hold otherwise would convert
indemnity insurance into litigation insurance.  In my opinion, such an
interpretation would violate the reasonable expectations of the parties absent
express language to that effect.  77                     
Although prior to Nichols, Canadian courts were split on the
issue, since Nichols courts have followed the dictum from that case. 
See Modern Livestock Ltd. v. Kansa General Insurance Co. (1993), 11
Alta. L.R. (3d) 355 (Q.B.); B.P. Canada Inc. v. Comco Service Station
Construction & Maintenance Ltd. (1990), 73 O.R. (2d) 317 (H.C.), and Kates
v. Hall, [1990] 5 W.W.R. 569 (B.C.S.C.).  78                     
This conclusion is consistent with the majority of American courts,
which have concluded that the “duty to defend arises when the underlying
complaint alleges any facts that might fall within the coverage of the policy”:
Colorado Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Co. v. Snowbarger, 934 P.2d 909
(Colo. Ct. App. 1997), at p. 912.  See also, e.g.,  Aerojet-General Corp. v.
Transport Indemnity Co., 948 P.2d 909 (Cal. 1997), at p. 921; Lawyers
Title Insurance Corp. v. Knopf, 674 A.2d 65 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1996), at
p. 70; Allstate Insurance Co. v. Patterson, 904 F. Supp. 1270 (D. Utah
1995); Allstate Insurance Co. v. Brown, 834 F. Supp. 854 (E.D. Pa.
1993).  To the contrary, see Gray v. Zurich Insurance Co., 419 P.2d 168
(Cal. 1966).  (ii)       The Relevance of the Pleadings  79                     
The appellant notes that the plaintiff’s statement of claim alleged the
non-intentional torts of negligence and breach of fiduciary duty.  He therefore
argues that the respondent has a duty to defend because the exclusion clause
does not apply to these claims.  However, these bare assertions alone cannot be
determinative.  Otherwise, the parties to an insurance contract would always be
at the mercy of the third-party pleader.  What really matters is not the labels
used by the plaintiff, but the true nature of the claim.  80                     
The general rule regarding the role of the pleadings is well stated by
Wallace J. in Bacon v. McBride (1984), 6 D.L.R. (4th) 96 (B.C.S.C.), at
p. 99:  The pleadings govern the duty to defend -- not the
insurer’s view of the validity or nature of the claim or by the possible
outcome of the litigation.  If the claim alleges a state of facts which, if
proven, would fall within the coverage of the policy the insurer is obliged to
defend the suit regardless of the truth or falsity of such allegations.  This principle
was expanded upon by McLachlin J., for the Court in Nichols, supra,
at pp. 810-11, in the following words cited in part above:  Where it is clear from the pleadings that the suit falls outside of the
coverage of the policy by reason of an exclusion clause, the duty to defend has
been held not to arise: Opron Maritimes Construction Ltd. v. Canadian
Indemnity Co. (1986), 19 C.C.L.I. 168 (N.B.C.A.), leave to appeal refused
by this Court, [1987] 1 S.C.R. xi.  At the same time, it is not necessary to prove that
the obligation to indemnify will in fact arise in order to trigger the duty to
defend. The mere possibility that a claim within the policy may succeed
suffices. In this sense, as noted earlier, the duty to defend is broader than
the duty to indemnify. O’Sullivan J.A. wrote in Prudential Life Insurance
Co. v. Manitoba Public Insurance Corp. (1976), 67 D.L.R. (3d) 521 (Man.
C.A.), at p. 524:  Furthermore, the duty to indemnify against the costs
of an action and to defend does not depend on the judgment obtained in the
action. The existence of the duty to defend depends on the nature of the
claim made, not on the judgment that results from the claim.   The duty to
defend is normally much broader than the duty to indemnify against a judgment.
(Emphasis added.)  In that case it was unclear whether the insurer might be liable to
indemnify under the policy, so the duty to defend was held to apply. In the
court’s view it would have been unjust for the insurers to be able to assert
that “the claim is probably groundless, or will probably end up falling outside
of the indemnity coverage. Since we have no proof that we owe an indemnity in
this case, we take the position that we owe no duty to defend”.  81                              
This does not, however, mean that the parties to an insurance contract
are to be bound by the plaintiff’s choice of labels, and thus defenceless
against inaccurate or manipulative pleadings.  Nichols only held that,
having determined the nature of the claim, an insured need not further prove
that the claim would succeed.  This is just common sense, since otherwise an
insured would have to prove he is actually liable in order to get an insurer to
defend a liability claim.  82                              
In my view, the correct approach in the circumstances of this case is to
ask if the allegations, properly construed, sound in intentional tort.  If they
do, the plaintiff’s use of the word “negligence” will not be controlling.  The
Rhode Island Supreme Court, in Peerless Insurance Co. v. Viegas, 667
A.2d 785 (1995), cleverly expressed the point as follows at p. 789:  In civil actions for damages that result from an act of child sexual
molestation, an insurer will be relieved from its duty to defend and to
indemnify its insured if the perpetrator is insured under a policy in which
there is contained an intentional act exclusion provision. . . . The fact that
the allegations in that complaint are described in terms of “negligence” is of
no consequence.  A plaintiff, by describing his or her cat to be a dog, cannot
simply by that descriptive designation cause the cat to bark.   83                              
To be somewhat more prosaic, when determining the scope of the duty to
defend, courts must take the factual allegations as pleaded, but then ask which
of the plaintiff’s legal claims could potentially be supported by those factual
allegations.  This is clear from Bacon, supra, at p. 99, where
the court limited the duty to defend to cases where the “claim alleges a state
of facts which, if proven, would fall within . . . coverage” (emphasis
added).  Similarly, in Nichols, supra, at p. 810, McLachlin J.
cited with approval O’Sullivan J.A.’s direction to look at “the nature of the
claim made”.  84                              
I would note that this approach can assist the insured, and not just the
insurer.  For example, as the California Supreme Court noted in Gray, supra,
at p. 176,  the complainant in the third party action drafts his complaint in the
broadest terms; he may very well stretch the action which lies in only
nonintentional conduct to the dramatic complaint that alleges intentional
misconduct.  In light of the likely overstatement of the complaint and of the
plasticity of modern pleading, we should hardly designate the third party as
the arbiter of the policy’s coverage.   Conversely, a
plaintiff may draft a statement of claim in a way that seeks to turn intention
into negligence in order to gain access to an insurer’s deep pockets.  See E.
S. Pryor, “The Stories We Tell: Intentional Harm and the Quest for Insurance
Funding” (1997), 75 Tex. L. Rev. 1721, at p. 1735.  A court must
therefore look beyond the labels used by the plaintiff, and determine the true
nature of the claim pleaded.  It is important to emphasize that at this stage a
court must not attempt to determine the merit of any of the plaintiff’s
claims.  Instead, it should simply determine whether, assuming the verity of
all of the plaintiff’s factual allegations, the pleadings could possibly
support the plaintiff’s legal allegations.   86                              
The reasons for this conclusion are twofold.  First, as discussed above,
one must always remember that insurance is presumed to cover only negligence,
not intentional injuries.   Second, this approach will discourage manipulative
pleadings by making it fruitless for plaintiffs to try to convert intentional
torts into negligence, or vice versa.  While courts should not concern
themselves with whether or not pleadings are designed to generate insurance
coverage, following the guidelines set out above will provide insurers with
sufficient protections against manipulative pleadings.  87                              
These concepts may seem rather complicated in the abstract, but they are
more straightforward to apply in practice.  While this issue is relatively new
to Canadian law, it has been extensively canvassed in the United States, where
courts have denied insurance coverage for claims of negligent battery,
negligent misrepresentation, negligent infliction of emotional distress,
negligent interference with familial relations, and any other claim of
“negligence” where it is derivative of an intentional sexual assault.  For
example, in Houg v. State Farm Fire and Casualty Co., 481 N.W.2d 393
(Minn. Ct. App. 1992), a parishioner sued a priest who had been counselling her
for sexual assault.  In addition to intentional sexual battery, the plaintiff
alleged negligent counselling by the defendant.  88                              
The court had little difficulty in finding that this allegation of
negligence did not raise the duty to defend, because “[a]ny negligent
counseling is so intertwined with [the insured]’s sexual exploitation of a
psychologically dependent person as to be inseparable” (Houg, supra,
at p. 397).  To use the approach I have set out above, the negligent
counselling claim was merely derivative of the sexual assault.  The fact that
there may have been negligent aspects of the priest’s conduct will not change
the essentially intentional nature of his conduct, for the purpose of the
exclusion clause.  To similar effect are:  Linebaugh v. Berdish, 376
N.W.2d 400 (Mich. Ct. App. 1985) (denying a claim for “negligent” child
molestation, which was “a transparent attempt to trigger insurance coverage by
characterizing allegations of tortious conduct under the guise of ‘negligent’
activity” (p. 406)); Horace Mann Insurance Co. v. Leeber, 376 S.E.2d 581
(W. Va. 1988) (alleged negligent seduction of a child by a teacher (p. 587)); Allstate
Insurance Co. v. Troelstrup, 789 P.2d 415 (Colo. 1990) (same (p. 418, n.
7)); Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance Co. v. Lajoie, 661 A.2d 85 (Vt.
1995) (agreeing with the trial judge that “labeling [the insured]’s conduct as
negligent ‘is simply a disingenuous attempt to create a factual dispute’” (p.
86)); Colorado Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Co. v. Snowbarger, supra
(“[T]he only facts recited in the complaint concern the repeated acts of sexual
assault.  There are no factual allegations provided in the complaint to
substantiate a negligence theory” (p. 912)).  89                              
I wish to make it clear that I am not denying that a given state of
facts may give rise to several different tort claims.  For example, in M.
(K.) v. M. (H.), [1992] 3 S.C.R. 6, the Court noted at p. 59 that “[i]ncest
is a breach of both common law and equitable duties”.  The Court therefore held
that limitation periods applying to intentional or negligent actions did not
apply to claims for breach of fiduciary duty.   While I fully agree with this
proposition, I would note that the present appeal presents a distinct
question.  In the context of an insurance contract’s intentional injury
exclusion clause, the goal is to determine the gravamen of the complaint, and
whether one can infer an intent to injure from that complaint.  Limitations
issues, as shown by M. (K.), are different, and not applicable in the
present appeal.  Indeed, this appeal’s holding with respect to the proper
characterization of a plaintiff’s tort allegations should not be taken to
affect any areas of law outside the insurance context presented by this appeal.  (iii)  Conclusion on the Scope of the Insurer’s
Duty to Defend  90                              
I therefore conclude that the respondent will only have to defend the
appellant if the plaintiff’s statement of claim alleges a state of facts that,
properly construed, would support an action that could potentially fall within
coverage.  C.  Is
There a Claim that Could Fall Within Coverage?  91                              
There is no dispute in this case that the plaintiff’s allegations fall
within the general coverage provisions of the policy.  All that is at stake is
whether the exclusion clause applies.  That clause states that the appellant is
“not insured for claims arising from: . . . bodily injury or property damage
caused by any intentional or criminal act or failure to act” by the insured.  92                              
At the outset, the wording of this clause presents a threshold issue. 
The respondent argues that the clause requires only an intentional act, not an
intent to injure.  The majority below agreed with this interpretation. 
However, I agree with Finch J.A.’s dissent on this point.  If the respondent
were correct, almost any act of negligence could be excluded under this
clause.  After all, most every act of negligence can be traced back to an
“intentional . . . act or failure to act”.  As this Court made clear in Canadian
Indemnity Co. v. Walkem Machinery & Equipment Ltd., [1976] 1 S.C.R.
309, “negligence is by far the most frequent source of exceptional liability
which [an insured] has to contend with.  Therefore, a policy which would not
cover liability due to negligence could not properly be called ‘comprehensive’”
(pp. 316-17).  Consistent with this decision, the purpose of insurance, and the
doctrines of reasonable expectations and contra proferentem referred to
above, I believe the exclusion clause must be read to require that the injuries
be intentionally caused, in that they are the product of an intentional tort
and not of negligence.  93                              
Our task, therefore, is to decide which of the plaintiff’s legal
allegations are properly pleaded, whether any of them are derivative, and
whether any of the surviving claims evince an intention to injure, thus
triggering the exclusion clause.  To do this, it is necessary to understand
precisely what the elements of the various torts alleged against the appellant
are.  If the elements of a tort claim require proof of conduct that also proves
an intent to injure, there will be no duty to defend because any potentially
successful claim would fall under the exclusion clause.  94                              
As will be seen from the following discussion, I conclude that each of
the plaintiff’s properly pleaded claims necessarily involves an intent to
injure, because each requires proof that the appellant either knew, or should
have known, that the plaintiff did not validly consent to sexual activity. 
Given this actual or constructive knowledge of non-consent, the law will not
permit the appellant to claim that he did not intend any harm.  The exclusion
therefore applies because there is no claim against the appellant that, if
successful, could potentially fall within coverage.  There being no potentially
indemnifiable claim, the respondent has no duty to defend.  (i)    Sexual Battery  (a)   Elements of the Tort of Sexual Battery  95                              
The tort of sexual battery is a relatively new one.  As Professor
Feldthusen points out in “The Canadian Experiment with the Civil Action for
Sexual Battery”, in N. J. Mullany, ed., Torts in the Nineties (1997),
274,  at p. 274, this action is one that has appeared more frequently in the
last 15 years.  The sexual battery action signals the possibility of “dramatic
changes to the law of consent, to the action for breach of fiduciary duty, to
the rules governing punitive damages, to the rules of discovery and to the law
of evidence” (p. 275).  However, this appeal requires no such changes. 
Contrary to McLachlin J.’s assertions, my approach entails nothing more than
understanding how traditional tort law applies in the context of sexual
battery.  96                              
Sexual battery is a form of battery, the traditional test for which is
relatively straightforward.  In M. (K.), supra, at p. 25, La
Forest J. defined assault and battery as “causing another person to apprehend
the infliction of immediate harmful or offensive force on her person coupled
with the actual infliction of that harmful or offensive force”.  What is
notably absent from this definition is any intent to injure.  Professor Klar,
in his second edition of Tort Law (1996), makes this point at p. 42:  For the tort of intentional battery, the defendant must have intended
an offensive, physical contact with the plaintiff.  The defendant need not have
intended to harm or injure the plaintiff, although in most battery cases there
is an intention to injure.   97                              
A. M. Linden, in Canadian Tort Law (6th ed. 1997), emphasizes
this point at p. 43: “A battery can be committed even though no harm or insult
is intended by the contact.  If the contact is offensive to the recipient, even
if a compliment was intended, it is tortious.”  See also Wilson v. Pringle,
[1986] 2 All E.R. 440 (C.A.), at p. 445; Spivey v. Battaglia, 258 So.2d
815 (Fla. 1972); O. M. Reynolds, “Tortious Battery: Is ‘I Didn’t Mean Any Harm’
Relevant?” (1984), 37 Okla. L. Rev. 717.  98                              
Intentional battery generally requires only the intent to cause the
physical consequences, namely, an offensive touching.  Klar, supra,
makes this point at p. 30:  Technically, however, the concept of “intention” in the intentional
torts does not require defendants to know that their acts will result in harm
to the plaintiffs.  Defendants must know only that their acts will result in
certain consequences.  It is not necessary for defendants to realize that these
intended consequences are in fact an infringement of the legal rights of
others.  Intention, in other words, focusses on physical consequences.  To similar
effect is Linden, supra, at p. 33: “Conduct is intentional if the actor
desires to produce the consequences that follow from an act.”  99                              
Moreover, if a tort is intended, it will not matter that the result was
more harmful than the actor should, or even could have foreseen.  Linden, supra,
at p. 45, quotes Borins Co. Ct. J. (as he then was) in Bettel v. Yim
(1978), 20 O.R. (2d) 617, at p. 628:   If physical contact was intended, the fact that its magnitude
exceeded all reasonable or intended expectations should make no difference. 
To hold otherwise ... would unduly narrow recovery where one deliberately
invades the bodily interests of another with the result that the totally
innocent plaintiff would be deprived of full recovery for the totality of the
injuries suffered as a result of the deliberate invasion of his bodily
interests. [Emphasis added.]   100                          
The appellant’s argument, in light of the foregoing, is quite simple. 
Battery requires only intentional contact, not an intent to harm.  Therefore,
he could have had non-consensual sex with the plaintiff, thus committing
battery, while thinking consent was present and thus not intending any harm. 
Any injuries could therefore have been unintentional, and the exclusion clause
should not apply because a claim within coverage could succeed.  101                          
The problem with the appellant’s argument is that it fails to recognize
the subtleties of intentional tort, particularly as they apply to sexual
battery.  The law of intentional tort has traditionally focussed on a different
set of problems from those presented in cases of sexual battery.  In
traditional battery, which is what the above-cited authorities were
considering, what is usually at stake is whether the defendant can be liable
for unintended physical consequences of his or her intentional actions, as in Bettel,
supra.  In these cases, the plaintiff’s consent is not in question
because of the nature of the conduct.  Punching, shooting, stabbing, or
otherwise attempting to injure another person is clearly offensive, and we
would not expect someone to consent to it.  See, e.g., Long v. Gardner
(1983), 144 D.L.R. (3d) 73 (Ont. H.C.); Veinot v. Veinot (1977), 81
D.L.R. (3d) 549 (N.S.C.A.); Rumsey v. The Queen (1984), 12 D.L.R. (4th)
44 (F.C.T.D.); Holt v. Verbruggen (1981), 20 C.C.L.T. 29 (B.C.S.C.).  As
Borins Co. Ct. J. said in Bettel, supra, at p. 627, defendants in
these cases have acted “with intent to violate the interests of others”
(quoting J. J. Atrens, “International Interference with the Person”, in Studies
in Canadian Tort Law (1968), 378).  Consent simply is not an issue, and
intent to injure is obvious.  102                          
Moreover, even in those cases where intent to harm is less obvious, lack
of consent usually is obvious.  For example, Reynolds, supra, discusses
various instances where courts have debated the need to show intent to harm. 
These cases typically involve childish pranks, see Garratt v. Dailey,
279 P.2d 1091 (Wash. 1955), Vosburg v. Putney, 50 N.W. 403 (Wis. 1891);
unconsented medical treatment, see Reibl v. Hughes, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 880,
Clayton v. New Dreamland Roller Skating Rink, Inc., 82 A.2d 458
(N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1951); or unintended consequences, see Bettel,
supra, Kirkpatrick v. Crutchfield, 100 S.E. 602 (N.C. 1919).  In
all of these situations, there is never any suggestion that the plaintiff
consented to the battery; the focus instead is on whether the appellant
intended any harm, and these cases have generally decided that no such intent is
needed.  103                          
What is necessary, therefore, is to decide what role consent plays in an
action for sexual battery.  It is clear that for traditional batteries, consent
is conceived of as an affirmative defence that must be raised by the defendant. 
As Cartwright J. said in Cook v. Lewis, [1951] S.C.R. 830, at p. 839,
“where a plaintiff is injured by force applied directly to him by the defendant
his case is made by proving this fact and the onus falls upon the defendant to
prove ‘that such trespass was utterly without his fault’”.  Obviously, one way
to make this showing, is by establishing that the plaintiff consented to the
touching.  Therefore in Norberg v. Wynrib, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 226,
La Forest J. stated in obiter dictum that “[c]onsent, express or
implied, is a defence to battery” (p. 246).  See also Reibl, supra,
at p. 890 (battery “casts upon the defendant the burden of proving consent to
what was done”); Hambley v. Shepley (1967), 63 D.L.R. (2d) 94 (Ont.
C.A.), at p. 95; Linden, supra, at p. 67; G. H. L. Fridman, The Law
of Torts in Canada (1989), vol. 1, at p. 63.  If consent is merely a
defence to battery, then presumably the plaintiff could establish battery
without showing lack of consent.  To paraphrase Cartwright J. in Cook,
the plaintiff’s case would be made by showing the mere application of force by
the defendant.  As I understand it, this is the position taken by McLachlin J. 
However, I have trouble concluding on these terms that the appellant
necessarily intended injury.  Without a fault requirement of any kind, I cannot
agree that the exclusion clause would necessarily apply, and the respondent
would therefore have a duty to defend.  104                          
This doctrine is of course consistent with our basic notions of
intentional tort.  A person’s body is inviolable, and those who interfere with
one’s “intangible right to autonomy over one’s own body” will be held liable:
Klar, supra, at p. 41.  However, not all intentional touchings are
presumptively instances of battery.  There are any number of contacts that are
usually consensual.  For example, in Mandel v. The Permanent (1985), 7
O.A.C. 365 (Div. Ct.), at p. 370, Henry J. noted that a man’s placing his hand
on the plaintiff’s arm to guide her to the door was “merely a polite gesture
and an accepted usage in daily life in a civilized society, whether or not she
was in fact consenting to it”.   A more obvious example is certain sports,
where physical contact is expected and even encouraged.  What these examples
show is that, in all cases, one must look to the context to understand the role
of consent.  105                          
While, for reasons already given, consent is not a well-developed
concept in battery cases, it is closely related to the more familiar
requirement in tort law that a given contact be “harmful or offensive” if it is
to generate liability: see M. (K.), supra, at p. 25.  Unlike more
traditional batteries, sexual activity by itself is not inherently harmful. 
Without denying the seriousness and frequency of sexual assault, the simple
fact is that sexual activity -- unlike being punched, stabbed, or shot -- is
usually consensual.  It generally becomes harmful only if it is non-consensual,
in the wider meaning of that word.  Without trying to catalogue the various
ways that consent may be vitiated, I note that Norberg, supra,
established that simply because someone ostensibly consents to sexual activity
does not mean that their consent is valid.  See, generally, Feldthusen, “The
Canadian Experiment with the Civil Action for Sexual Battery”, supra, at
pp. 282-86.  106                          
That the “harmful or offensive” standard is a familiar one in tort law
is shown by Wiffin v. Kincard (1807), 2 Bos. & Pul. (N.R.) 471, 127
E.R. 713 (C.P.), and Coward v. Baddeley (1859), 4 H. & N. 478, 157
E.R. 927 (Ex.).  In those cases, the courts determined that touching someone on
the shoulder to get their attention is not a battery, even if the recipient
objected to the contact.  As Linden, supra, at p. 44, points out:  A line must be drawn between those contacts which are regarded as normal
everyday events, which people must put up with in a crowded world, and those
which are considered to be offensive and, therefore, unacceptable.  Klar, supra,
at pp. 43-44, elaborates on this point:  The distinction between “hostile” and “friendly”
contact seems to depend upon the standard of generally acceptable conduct in
society.  The test is objective: what would the reasonable person consider
to be acceptable?  Two recent English cases demonstrate this proposition. 
In the first, Collins v. Wilcock, [1984] 1 W.L.R. 1172 (Q.B.), the act
of a police officer in taking hold of someone’s arm to restrain her from
walking off was deemed to constitute a battery.  The test suggested by Goff
L.J. was this: “whether the physical conduct so persisted in has in the
circumstances gone beyond generally acceptable standards of conduct.” Ibid.,
at 1178. . . .  In the second case, Wilson v. Pringle, [1986] 2 All E.R.
440 (C.A.), a schoolboy playfully pulled the schoolbag off the plaintiff’s
shoulder, causing him injury.  In deciding whether this was a hostile touching
and consequently a battery, Croom-Johnson L.J. . . . agreed that certain
conduct must be judged as “acceptable in the ordinary conduct of everyday
life.” [Emphasis added.]   107                          
In England, courts have concluded that “[t]he absence of consent is so
inherent in the notion of a tortious invasion of interests in the person that
the absence of consent must be established by the plaintiff”: Street on
Torts (10th ed. 1999), at p. 32.  This issue was decided by Freeman v.
Home Office, [1983] 3 All E.R. 589 (Q.B.), aff’d [1984] 1 All E.R. 1036
(C.A.), where the court held that a prisoner suing for battery because of
therapeutic drug injections had the burden of proving non-consent.  While it is
not necessary in this appeal to decide whether the burden of proving
non-consent will always rest on the plaintiff, I believe that it should for
sexual battery.  To repeat, sexual contact is only “harmful or offensive” when
it is non-consensual.  To succeed in an action for intentional battery, one
must prove both that (a) the defendant intended to do the action; and (b) the
reasonable person would have perceived that action as being harmful or
offensive.  For sexual activity, an action is harmful or offensive if it is
non-consensual.  Therefore in sexual battery, the trier of fact must be
satisfied that the defendant intended to engage in sexual activity which a
reasonable person would have perceived to be non-consensual.  108                          
The New Zealand High Court came to the same conclusion in H. v. R.,
[1996] 1 N.Z.L.R. 299, at p. 305:  In sexual abuse cases, a conceptual difficulty with
the tort has been as to whether an absence of consent is an element of the
tort, or a defence.  It seems to me that to the extent that it has always been
necessary for the plaintiff to prove a hostile intent to ground this tort, the
burden of demonstrating a lack of consent must be surmounted by the plaintiff,
of course on the civil standard.  I[f] that is so, lack of consent has always
been, strictu sensu, an element of the offence.  In short, the
appellant’s attempt to convert an intentional tort into negligence because of
the possibility that he lacked a subjective intent to injure must fail. 
Consent, in so far as it is concerned with whether something is harmful or
offensive, is an objective standard.  If the plaintiff can prove that the
appellant failed to meet this standard, the latter is liable for intentional
sexual battery, not negligence.  109                          
In summary, I would advance the following basic propositions.   For
there to be a duty to defend, there must be the possibility of a duty to
indemnify.  In the context of the pleadings in this case raising in substance a
sexual assault through a sexual battery, the issue of consent produces two
possible results for the purposes of the duty to defend, both of which are
unfavourable to the appellant.  If the consent of the plaintiff was present,
then no claim of sexual battery is made out since the conduct of the appellant
would not be regarded objectively as being harmful or offensive, and therefore
the duty to indemnify would not arise because the plaintiff’s claim has no
possibility of success.  See State Farm Fire and Casualty Co. v. Williams,
355 N.W.2d 421 (Minn. 1984), at p. 424.  On the other hand, if consent of the
plaintiff is absent, the conduct of the appellant would be actionable as an
intentional tort of sexual battery.  As I will discuss, infra, in such a
case an intent to harm is inferred, the exclusion clause would apply, and there
would be no duty to indemnify.  There being no state of affairs in which there
could be a duty to indemnify, the duty to defend does not apply.  110                          
I wish to emphasize that the foregoing should not be taken to endorse in
any way the inappropriate stereotype that women are to be presumed willing
partners to sexual activity.  See R. v. Mills, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 668, at
para. 90; R. v. Osolin, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595, at p. 670; R. v.
Seaboyer, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577, at p. 604;  Federal/Provincial/Territorial
Working Group of Attorneys General Officials on Gender Equality in the Canadian
Justice System, Gender Equality in the Canadian Justice System: Summary
Document and Proposals for Action (1992). Nothing in these reasons should
be read to the contrary.  Putting the onus of proving lack of consent on the
plaintiff simply recognizes that in the sexual assault context,
“non-consensual” is equivalent to “harmful or offensive”; and the latter has
always been an element of the plaintiff’s case.  111                          
I would also emphasize that the plaintiff’s burden in a civil action to
prove non-consent is much less onerous than the one faced by the prosecution in
a criminal case.  As Major J. noted in R. v. Ewanchuk, [1999] 1 S.C.R.
330, at para. 42, the mens rea of criminal sexual assault requires the
Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was “knowing of, or
being reckless of or wilfully blind to, a lack of consent on the part of the
person touched”.  To prove the civil tort of sexual battery, by contrast, one
need only prove by a balance of probabilities that the defendant knew or ought
to have known that the plaintiff did not consent.  112                          
The onus of proving consent will be largely of theoretical importance. 
To meet her initial burden, the plaintiff need simply allege that the sexual
activity was non-consensual.  The issue will then be the same regardless of
where the onus lies: on the balance of probabilities, should the defendant have
known that the plaintiff did not validly consent?  The only time the
plaintiff’s burden of pleading non-consent would be relevant is in those rare
cases where, for whatever reason, the defence chooses to present no evidence. 
In such a case, having the onus on the plaintiff ensures that the defendant
will only be liable if the plaintiff alleges, at a minimum, that the sexual
activity was non-consensual.  While the practical difference is thus minimal, I
believe the theoretical one is important.  Placing the onus of proving lack of
consent on the plaintiff better reflects our traditional notions of tort law,
as adapted to the relatively new tort of sexual battery.  113                          
Having concluded that in the context of sexual battery the “harmful or
offensive” element is satisfied by showing lack of consent, I will now discuss
whether the elements of a sexual battery claim necessarily prove an intent to
injure on the part of the defendant.  If a sexual battery claim requires proof
of elements that also establish an intent to injure, then any successful claim
would necessarily be excluded under the policy and there can be no duty to
defend such a claim.  (b)   Are There Properly Pleaded Allegations of
Sexual Battery that Could Trigger the Duty to Indemnify?     114                          
As set out above, the first step is to determine whether there are
properly pleaded allegations of sexual battery.  In my opinion, this
requirement is clearly satisfied.  The plaintiff has alleged intentional sexual
activity by the appellant, to which the plaintiff did not consent.  Moreover,
para. 117 of the statement of claim specifically alleges that “Scalera knew or
ought to have known that [the plaintiff] did not consent to the Scalera sexual
acts”.  The next question is whether sexual battery necessarily implies an
intent to injure sufficient to trigger the exclusion clause.  115                          
This Court was presented with this issue, in a different context, in Norberg,
supra.  In that case the Court split three ways on the appropriate
characterization of the actions of a doctor who convinced a drug-addicted
patient to engage in sexual acts with him in return for pills to which she was
addicted.  This issue is not before the Court in this appeal.  However, I will
assume all three approaches set out in that case -- sexual battery, breach of
duty, and breach of fiduciary duty -- are possible.  116                          
Writing for himself, Gonthier and Cory JJ., La Forest J. concluded that
Wynrib’s conduct amounted to sexual assault.  Drawing an analogy to contract
law, La Forest J. concluded that consent may be vitiated where “there is an
overwhelming imbalance in the power relationship between the parties” (p.
248).  If there was no valid consent, Wynrib was liable for battery.  117                          
What La Forest J.’s reasons left undecided is whether or not Wynrib had
any intent to harm, or indeed whether such intent is necessary for sexual
battery.  La Forest J. did not inquire into subjective intent to harm, but
instead focused on the presence or absence of valid consent.  This approach is
consistent with the few reported lower court decisions addressing sexual
assault.  For example, in M. (M.) v. K. (K.) (1989), 61 D.L.R. (4th) 392
(B.C.C.A.), the court concluded that notwithstanding the fact that the victim
initiated the sexual contact, there could be no valid consent between a
41-year-old man and his 15-year-old foster daughter.  Harder v. Brown
(1989), 50 C.C.L.T. 85 (B.C.S.C.), and Lyth v. Dagg (1988), 46 C.C.L.T.
25 (B.C.S.C.), similarly declined to consider intention to harm, instead
finding that consent was vitiated by the extreme power imbalances in the
relationships.  118                          
One conclusion that could be drawn from these cases is that sexual
battery requires no intent to harm, only the absence of consent.  If this is
correct, the exclusion clause would not necessarily apply to a sexual battery
claim, and the respondent would have a duty to defend.  However, in my view
this interpretation is not correct.  Consent, linked as it is to the “harmful
or offensive” standard, as already discussed, is an objective standard.  Sexual
battery requires an objective set of circumstances such that the defendant
either knew or should have known that there was no valid consent.  119                          
Leaving aside the physical injuries that can be inflicted by sexual
assault, there can be no question that it occasions untold injury to the
victim’s dignity, physical integrity, and psychological well-being.  The same
facts that prove lack of consent will prove intent to injure; this follows
because if a reasonable person should have known there was no consent, the law
will not excuse that person’s failure to perceive the lack of consent.  On the
other hand, a defendant will not be liable for sexual assault if there was no
way for him or her to know that the victim did not, or could not, consent to
sexual activity.  120                          
This Court has recognized the grave harm occasioned by sexual assault. 
For example, in R. v. McCraw, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 72, the Court held that
threats of rape amounted to threats of serious bodily harm, within the meaning
of s. 264.1(1) (a) of the Criminal Code .  Cory J. aptly summarized
the harm inherent in non-consensual sexual activity, at pp. 83-84:    See also Osolin,
supra, at p. 669; Ewanchuk, supra, at para. 69 (per
L’Heureux-Dubé J.).  While McCraw was concerned with forcible rape, I do
not think the harm is any less real just because the victim has been coerced
into sex by mental as opposed to physical means.  It can hardly be disputed, I
think, that any type of non-consensual sex clearly evinces an intent to harm
the victim thereof.  121                          
In the considerable jurisprudence on the point, most U.S. courts have
reached the same conclusion.  The majority of these cases have involved sexual
assaults of children.  Courts have had little difficulty in concluding that
defendants in these cases are presumed to intend harm to their victims -- 
notwithstanding the fact that “males who are involved in such activities do not
expect or intend that the females will sustain any injury”: CNA Insurance
Co. v. McGinnis, 666 S.W.2d 689  (Ark. 1984), at p. 690.  See also B.B.
v. Continental Insurance Co., 8 F.3d 1288 (8th Cir. 1993); J.C. Penney
Casualty Insurance Co. v. M.K., 804 P.2d 689 (Cal. 1991); Horace Mann
Insurance Co. v. Leeber, supra; State Farm Fire & Casualty
Co. v. D.T.S., 867 S.W.2d 642 (Mo. Ct. App. 1993); Amercian States
Insurance Co. v. Borbor, 826 F.2d 888 (9th Cir. 1987); Troelstrup v.
District Court, 712 P.2d 1010 (Colo. 1986) (en banc); Rodriguez
v. Williams, 729 P.2d 627 (Wash. 1986) (en banc); Linebaugh v.
Berdish, supra; Horace Mann Insurance Co. v. Independent School
District No. 656, 355 N.W.2d 413 (Minn. 1984).  These cases are obviously
much easier than the present appeal.  It is difficult to imagine someone
successfully arguing that they intended no harm from sex with someone too young
to consent to sexual activity.  122                          
While there is more of a divergence of opinion when it comes to assaults
on adults, some U.S. courts have also inferred an intent to harm in these cases. 
For example, in State Farm Fire and Casualty Co. v. Williams, supra,
the court denied insurance coverage to someone who had sexually assaulted a man
with cerebral palsy who was confined to a wheelchair.  The court first examined
cases involving assaults on minors, and concluded as follows, at p. 424:   Does the fact that Williams, the victim, was an adult distinguish this
case?  We think not.  Neither the insured nor the insurer in entering into the
insurance contract contemplated coverage against claims arising out of
non-consensual sexual assaults.  On the other hand, if the sexual contacts were
consensual, as asserted by respondent Keller, there would be no assault and
hence no claim for recovery.   See also Houg,
supra; Altena v. United Fire and Casualty Co., 422 N.W.2d 485 (Iowa
1988); and D. S. Florig, “Insurance Coverage for Sexual Abuse or Molestation”
(1995), 30 Tort & Ins. L.J.
699.  123                          
Finally, I would note that the Canadian case most directly on point has
reached a similar conclusion.  Wilkieson-Valiente v. Wilkieson, [1996]
I.L.R. ¶1-3351 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)), involved an action by a young girl
against her stepfather.  The court disagreed with the defendant’s assertion
that “it is possible to commit a sexual assault without necessarily ‘intending’
injury” (p. 4132).  Instead, the court concluded as follows at p. 4133:  It may be conceivable, in rare circumstances, to commit a sexual
assault without an intent to cause any psychological harm, (such as in the case
of a transitory touching of a sleeping or unconscious victim).  However,
bearing in mind that “intentionally” does not refer to “desired result” but
“awareness of possible result” such cases will be rare indeed.  Particularly,
as here, where the pleadings claim repeated sexual assaults over a period of
many years on a victim who is a child, it is inconceivable that any
right-thinking person would not be fully aware of the possible, indeed probable
consequences of such conduct; that is, psychological harm to the victim.   124                          
Unlike the Court in Wilkieson-Valiente, supra, I cannot
accept that one can commit sexual assault without an intent to harm: see
Linden, supra, at p. 45; Restatement (Second) of Torts, § 18 cmt.
d (1965).  Even if the victim is unconscious, the perpetrator has still
violated another person’s physical integrity.  However, I agree that to prove
sexual assault, a plaintiff must prove sufficient culpability on the part of
the defendant that an intent to harm follows.  Accordingly, the exclusion
clause must apply, and the respondent has no duty to defend the plaintiff’s
claim of sexual battery.  (ii)   Negligent Battery  (a)   Elements of Negligent Battery  125                          
Klar, supra, defines negligent battery at p. 47:  A negligent battery exists when the defendant
causes a direct, offensive, physical contact with the plaintiff as a result of
negligent conduct.  The defendant’s negligence consists of unreasonably
disregarding a foreseeable risk of contact, even though the contact was neither
desired nor substantially certain to occur.   The plaintiff
has also alleged breach of duty, which is essentially negligence.  In Norberg,
supra, Sopinka J. relied on this theory to find Dr. Wynrib liable to Ms.
Norberg.  However, his reasoning was based on the professional duty owed by a
physician to a patient.  No such duty was alleged in the present appeal. 
Instead, and absent any particularized pleading by the plaintiff, I must
presume that she is relying on a traditional negligent battery theory.   126                          
As Klar’s definition makes clear, the “negligence” in negligent battery
refers only to the “risk of contact”.  One might commit negligent battery by
carelessly stretching one’s arms, thereby striking someone.  More commonly,
negligent battery cases have involved projectiles.  See Cook, supra;
Ellison v. Rogers (1967), 67 D.L.R. (2d) 21 (Ont. H.C.); Hatton v.
Webb (1977), 81 D.L.R. (3d) 377 (Alta. Dist. Ct.).  The important point is
that negligent battery is concerned with the physical consequences of
one’s actions.  However, the appellant has not disputed the physical
consequence of his actions for the purposes of this appeal.  He has, appropriately,
assumed the truth of the allegations contained in the plaintiff’s Statement of
Claim, which asserts that he intended to have sexual relations with the
plaintiff.  The only question is whether it was consensual, which is determined
on an objective standard, as I have explained above.  127                          
I therefore do not find Co-operative Fire & Casualty Co. v.
Saindon, supra; Newcastle (Town) v. Mattatall (1988), 52
D.L.R. (4th) 356 (N.B.C.A.); Long Lake School Division No. 30 of
Saskatchewan Board of Education v. Schatz (1986), 18 C.C.L.I. 232 (Sask.
C.A.), and Devlin v. Co-operative Fire & Casualty Co. (1978), 90
D.L.R. (3d) 444 (Alta. C.A.), to be relevant.  These cases are not helpful in
the present appeal, as they all involved unforeseen physical
consequences of the actions of the insured, and asked whether the result was
“substantially certain” given the defendant’s actions.  The “substantial
certainty” test, focusing as it does on physical consequences, has no bearing
on the issue of consent.  The case at bar involves deciding solely whether the
plaintiff validly consented to the appellant’s actions.  A negligent battery is
properly pleaded only if the plaintiff alleges that the appellant was negligent
as to the physical consequences of his actions; in other words, that he did not
intend for sexual contact to occur.  As explained above, lack of intention to
have non-consensual sex is more properly construed as going to the
“harmful or offensive” element of intentional battery, and will not found a
claim for negligent battery.  Therefore negligent battery will only be relevant
if the pleadings allege that the appellant negligently harmed the plaintiff by
disregarding a foreseeable risk of physical contact.  No such allegation has
been made.  As the court said in Pistolesi v. Nationwide Mutual Fire
Insurance Co., 644 N.Y.S.2d 819 (App. Div. 1996), at p. 820:  . . . the mere allegation that the injuries were the unintended result
of an intentional act does not convert the cause of action from one sounding in
intentional tort to one sounding in negligence. . . .   (b)   Are There Properly Pleaded Allegations of
Negligent Battery That Could Trigger the Duty to Indemnify?   128                          
Once again, the first step is to determine whether negligent battery was
properly pleaded.  I have concluded that it was not.  As discussed above,
negligent battery occurs when the defendant causes harm by negligently
disregarding a foreseeable risk of physical contact.  The plaintiff has not
alleged such conduct; both parties have assumed, for the purposes of  this
appeal,  that the appellant intended to have sexual contact with the
plaintiff.  Since there is no properly pleaded allegation of negligent battery,
it is unnecessary to determine whether the exclusion clause would apply to such
a claim.  (iii)  Negligent Misrepresentations  129                          
Aside from the vague assertions of “breach of duty”, the appellant notes
that the plaintiff has alleged negligent acts independent of the sexual
assault.  For example, the statement of claim alleges negligent
misrepresentations.  It is unnecessary to spend much time on this issue.  It is
well established that one can be liable for damages to personal security caused
by negligent statements, as well as acts:  A statement of fact, on which the plaintiff relied, would give rise to
liability if (i) it were inaccurate as a result of negligence (and a
fortiori deceit); and (ii) it caused physical injury to the plaintiff or
damage to his property.   (Fridman, supra, at p. 263.)  See also Klar,
supra, at p. 177; M’Alister v. Stevenson, [1932] A.C. 562 (H.L.),
at pp. 580-81 (per Atkin L.J.).  130                          
Assuming without deciding that negligent misrepresentation has been
properly pleaded here, I find that these claims are entirely derivative of the
intentional sexual battery, and are thus subsumed into the latter for the
purposes of the exclusion clause.  The statement of claim alleges that the
misrepresentations were designed to seduce the plaintiff, and convince her to
engage in sexual activity with the appellant.  As such, they were entirely
subservient to the sexual battery.  They arise from the same actions and cause
the same harm.  Indeed, para. 111 of the plaintiff’s statement of claim alleges
that the appellant “made the Scalera Representations intending to persuade [the
plaintiff] to submit to the Scalera sexual acts”.  The West Virginia Supreme Court
of Appeals reached the same conclusion in Horace Mann Insurance Co. v.
Leeber, supra, at p. 587, where an exclusion clause applied in spite
of allegations of negligent seduction of a student by a teacher.  The court
concluded that the allegations of “negligence” in the complaint were  a transparent attempt to trigger insurance coverage by characterizing
allegations of [intentional] tortious conduct under the guise of ‘negligent’
activity.  [Insertion in Leeber; quoting Linebaugh, supra,
at p. 406.]  I reach the
same conclusion in this appeal.  While courts must be careful not to restrict
pleading in the alternative unduly and should only subsume allegations of
negligence that are clearly derivative of the intentional tort, I conclude that
this is one of those cases.  The plaintiff has clearly alleged intentional
conduct by the appellant.  Without ruling out the possibility that the
plaintiff’s pleadings could support claims of both intention and negligence as
a matter of tort law, I conclude as a matter of insurance law that the
negligent claims are subsumed for the purposes of the exclusion clause.  The
allegations of negligent misrepresentation are derivative of the intentional
sexual assault claims, and cannot trigger the duty to defend.  (iv)  Breach of Fiduciary Duty  131                          
The final approach to allegations of sexual misconduct in Norberg,
supra, was the fiduciary duty route taken by McLachlin J.,
L’Heureux-Dubé J. concurring.  They concluded that the duty owed from a doctor
to the patient met the test for fiduciary relationships set out by Wilson J. in
Frame v. Smith, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 99, at p. 136.  No doubt relying on
these reasons, the plaintiff has also alleged breach of fiduciary duties
against the appellant.  132                          
Without commenting on whether the relationship between the appellant and
the plaintiff could potentially be characterized as a fiduciary one, the
plaintiff’s claims for breach of fiduciary duty are excluded much for the same
reasons as the negligence claims.  Looking beyond the label to what is actually
alleged in the pleadings, and without expressing any opinion on the validity of
a fiduciary duty claim on the facts of this appeal, there are no facts pleaded
to suggest that the breach of fiduciary duty was anything but intentional in
nature.  The appellant was alleged to have intentionally seduced the plaintiff,
and whether or not this can be characterized as a fiduciary duty claim, any
injuries resulting therefrom were caused intentionally. The harm caused by any
breach of fiduciary duty is identical to that caused by the sexual battery, and
the claim is therefore subsumed, for the purpose of the exclusion clause, into
the intentional battery.  (v)   Conclusion  133                          
In summary, all of the plaintiff’s claims against the appellant are
covered by the exclusion clause for injuries caused intentionally.  To prove
her case, the plaintiff will have to establish that the appellant knew or
should have known that the plaintiff did not validly consent to sexual
relations with him.  In such a situation, the appellant will not be heard to
complain that he did not intend any harm.  One who engages in objectively
non-consensual sexual activity will be presumed to have intended harm; whether
or not he subjectively intended harm will not change the injurious nature of
his actions, and will not deny an insurer its bargained-for exclusion of
intentionally injurious activities.  This conclusion is consistent with the
basic principles of insurance law discussed above.  134                          
In particular, it is consistent with the reasonable expectations of the
parties.  In this respect, I agree with the Iowa Supreme Court in Altena,
supra, at p. 490, where the court quoted the following passage from Rodriguez
by Brennan v. Williams, 713 P.2d 135 (Wash. Ct. App. 1986), at pp. 137-38:  . . . [t]he average person purchasing homeowner’s insurance would
cringe at the very suggestion that [the person] was paying for such coverage. 
And certainly [the person] would not want to share that type of risk with other
homeowner’s policy holders. [Insertions added in Altena.]  Similarly, in Horace
Mann Insurance Co. v. Leeber, supra, at pp. 586-87, the court said
the following:  The majority rule rejecting an alleged duty to
defend or to pay in sexual misconduct liability insurance cases is consistent
with the “doctrine of reasonable expectations.” ... [W]e simply believe that
the insured under a homeowner’s insurance policy does not reasonably expect the
insurer to defend an action against the insured for, and to pay for, damages
alleged to have been caused by the sexual misconduct of the insured.  See also R.
Bell, “Sexual Abuse and Institutions: Insurance Issues” (1996), 6 C.I.L.R.
53, at pp. 54-55.  135                          
This conclusion is also consistent with basic insurance theory. 
Insurance is meant to cover risk of loss.  See C. Brown, Insurance Law in
Canada (loose-leaf), vol. 1, at p. 1-1.  Where the loss is caused
intentionally, it is hardly the result of a risk.  Regardless of whether an
insurance company could find a way profitably to insure someone against
intentionally caused injuries, the respondent clearly did not believe it was
doing so when it wrote the policy at issue in this appeal.  Sexually assaulting
someone is not like getting in a car accident, or having someone injure
themselves by slipping on an unshovelled sidewalk.  If the plaintiff is to
succeed, she must prove that the appellant’s conduct went beyond mere
negligence, and rose to the level of sexual assault.  Absent express language
to the contrary, I am unable to conclude that the parties to this insurance
contract agreed to cover such a claim.  136                          
Nor do I believe that contra proferentem, or any other insurance
principle, is sufficient to overcome these conclusions.  While ambiguous
language will often be construed against the insurer, this consideration alone
cannot be determinative.  Moreover, I find that the most accurate reading of
the language and intentions of the contract is that the exclusion clause
applies to the allegations of sexual misconduct made by the plaintiff.  D.  Other
Arguments Raised by the Respondent  137                          
The respondent has also argued that the actions alleged by the plaintiff
are not “accidents” or “occurrences”, as required by the policy, and that s. 28
of the British Columbia Insurance Act, excludes the claim because it
alleges a criminal act.  Given my interpretation of the exclusion clause, I
find it unnecessary to consider these other questions and therefore express no
opinion on them.  VI.  Summary
and Disposition  138                          
I believe my conclusions in this appeal can be summarized fairly
briefly:  1.                An insurance company only has a
duty to defend when a lawsuit against the insured raises a claim that could
potentially fall within coverage.  2.                In determining if a claim falls
within coverage, courts are not bound by the labels chosen by the plaintiff,
but must determine the true nature of the claim stated in the pleadings.  3.                In this appeal, the plaintiff has
stated three possible claims arising out of an alleged sexual assault: sexual
battery, negligent battery, and breach of fiduciary duty.  None of these claims
could potentially fall within coverage because, even if ultimately successful,
the respondent will have no duty to indemnify owing to the insurance policy’s
exclusion for injuries caused intentionally by the insured.  a.    Sexual battery requires proof that a
reasonable person should have known that the plaintiff did not validly consent
to the sexual activity in question.  Since non-consensual sexual activity is
inherently harmful, any injuries resulting therefrom are intentionally caused,
and the exclusion clause would apply.  If, to the contrary, a reasonable person
would not have known that the plaintiff did not validly consent, the
plaintiff’s claim will fail, there will be no duty to indemnify, and therefore
equally no duty to defend.  b.    Claims of negligence and breach of fiduciary
duty are either not properly pleaded, or are subsumed into the sexual battery
in this case because these claims are based on the same facts and resulted in
the same harm.  Therefore the exclusion clause applies equally to them.  4.                Since there is no possible set of
circumstances in which one of the plaintiff’s claims could trigger indemnity,
there is no duty to defend.  139                          
For the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.  Appeal dismissed with costs. Solicitors for the appellant:  Cran Law Offices, Vancouver.  Solicitors for the respondent:  Dolden Walker Folick,
Vancouver.
