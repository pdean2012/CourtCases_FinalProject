Abella, Charron, Rothstein and Cromwell JJ. on appeal from the court of appeal for british columbia                     Torts
— Libel and slander — Publication — Internet — Defendant creating hyperlinks to
allegedly defamatory articles — Whether hyperlinking, in and of itself,
constitutes publication.                     N
owns and operates a website in British Columbia containing commentary about
various issues, including free speech and the Internet.  One of the articles he
posted on it contained shallow and deep hyperlinks to other websites, which in
turn contained information about C.  C sued N on the basis that two of the
hyperlinks he created connected to defamatory material, and that by using those
hyperlinks, N was publishing the defamatory information.  At trial, the judge
concluded that the mere creation of a hyperlink in a website does not lead to a
presumption that someone actually used the hyperlink to access the impugned
words.  The judge agreed that hyperlinks were analogous to footnotes since they
only refer to another source without repeating it.  Since there was no
repetition, there was no publication.  Furthermore, in the absence of evidence
that anyone other than C used the links and read the words to which they
linked, there could not be a finding of publication.  A majority of the Court
of Appeal upheld the decision, finding that while some words in an article may
suggest that a particular hyperlink is an encouragement or invitation to view
the impugned site, there was no such encouragement or invitation in this case. 
In addition, the number of “hits” on the article itself was an insufficient
basis for drawing an inference in this case that a third party had read the
defamatory words.  The dissenting judge held that there was publication.  The
fact that N’s website had been viewed 1,788 times made it unlikely that no one
had followed the hyperlinks and read the impugned article.  Furthermore, the
context of the article suggested that readers were encouraged or invited to
click on the links.                     Held: 
The appeal should be dismissed.                     Per
Binnie, LeBel, Abella, Charron, Rothstein and Cromwell JJ.:  To prove the
publication element of defamation, a plaintiff must establish that the
defendant has, by any act, conveyed defamatory meaning to a single third party
who has received it.  Traditionally, the form the defendant’s act takes and the
manner in which it assists in causing the defamatory content to reach the third
party are irrelevant.  Applying this traditional rule to hyperlinks, however,
would have the effect of creating a presumption of liability for all
hyperlinkers.  This would seriously restrict the flow of information on the
Internet and, as a result, freedom of expression.                     Hyperlinks
are, in essence, references, which are fundamentally different from other acts
of “publication”.  Hyperlinks and references both communicate that something
exists, but do not, by themselves, communicate its content.  They both require
some act on the part of a third party before he or she gains access to the
content.  The fact that access to that content is far easier with hyperlinks
than with footnotes does not change the reality that a hyperlink, by itself, is
content-neutral.  Furthermore, inserting a hyperlink into a text gives the
author no control over the content in the secondary article to which he or she
has linked.                     A
hyperlink, by itself, should never be seen as “publication” of the content to
which it refers.  When a person follows a hyperlink to a secondary source that
contains defamatory words, the actual creator or poster of the defamatory words
in the secondary material is the person who is publishing the libel. Only when
a hyperlinker presents content from the hyperlinked material in a way that
actually repeats the defamatory content, should that content be considered to
be “published” by the hyperlinker.                     Here,
nothing on N’s page is itself alleged to be defamatory.  Since the use of a
hyperlink cannot, by itself, amount to publication even if the hyperlink is
followed and the defamatory content is accessed, N has not published the
defamatory content and C’s action cannot succeed.                     Per
McLachlin C.J. and Fish J.:  The reasons of the majority are agreed
with substantially. However, a hyperlink should constitute publication if, read
contextually, the text that includes the hyperlink constitutes adoption or
endorsement of the specific content it links to.  A mere general reference to a
Web site is not enough to find publication.                     Per
Deschamps J.:  Excluding hyperlinks from the scope of the publication rule
is an inadequate solution to the novel issues raised by the Internet.  This
blanket exclusion exaggerates the difference between references and other acts
of publication, and treats all references, from footnotes to hyperlinks, alike,
thereby disregarding the fact that references vary greatly in how they make
defamatory information available to third parties and, consequently, in the
harm they can cause to people’s reputations.                     In
the common law of defamation, publication has two components: (1) an act
that makes the defamatory information available to a third party in a
comprehensible form, and (2) the receipt of the information by a third party in
such a way that it is understood.                     In
the context of Internet hyperlinks, a simple reference, absent evidence that
someone actually viewed and understood the defamatory information to which it
directs third parties, is not publication of that content.  In order to satisfy
the requirements of the first component of publication, the plaintiff must
establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the hyperlinker performed a
deliberate act that made defamatory information readily available to a third
party in a comprehensible form.  An act is deliberate if the defendant played
more than a passive instrumental role in making the information available.  In
determining whether hyperlinked information is readily available, a court
should consider a number of factors, including whether the hyperlink is user-activated
or automatic, whether it is a shallow or a deep link, and whether the linked
information is available to the general public (as opposed to being
restricted).  Any matter that has a bearing on the ease with which the
referenced information could be accessed will be relevant to the inquiry.                     For
an action in defamation to succeed, the plaintiff must also satisfy the
requirements of the second component of publication on a balance of
probabilities, namely that a third party received and understood the defamatory
information.  This requirement can be satisfied either by adducing direct
evidence or by asking the court to draw an inference based on, notably, whether
the link was user-activated or automatic; whether it was a deep or a shallow
link; whether the page contained more than one hyperlink and, if so, where the
impugned link was located in relation to others; the context in which the link
was presented to users; the number of hits on the page containing the
hyperlink; the number of hits on the page containing the linked information
(both before and after the page containing the link was posted); whether access
to the Web sites in question was general or restricted; whether changes were
made to the linked information and, if so, how they correlate with the number
of hits on the page containing that information; and evidence concerning the
behaviour of Internet users.  Once the plaintiff establishes prima facie
liability for defamation, the defendant can invoke any available defences.                     Here,
N acted as more than a mere conduit in making the hyperlinked information
available.  His action was deliberate.  However, having regard to the totality
of the circumstances, it cannot be inferred that the first, shallow hyperlink
made the defamatory content readily available.  The various articles were not
placed on the other site’s home page and they had separate addresses.  The fact
that the reader had to take further action in order to find the defamatory
material constituted a meaningful barrier to the receipt, by a third party, of
the linked information.  The second, deep hyperlink, however, did make the
content readily available.  All the reader had to do to gain access to the
article was to click on the link, which does not constitute a barrier to the
availability of the material.  Thus, C has satisfied the requirements of the
first component of publication on a balance of probabilities where this link is
concerned.  However, the nature of N’s article, the way the various links were
presented and the number of hits on the article do not support an inference
that the allegedly defamatory information was brought to the knowledge of some
third person.  The defamation action with respect to either of the impugned
hyperlinks cannot succeed. Cases Cited By

judgment of Binnie, LeBel, Abella, Charron, Rothstein and Cromwell JJ. was
delivered by [1]                             
Abella J. — To succeed in an
action for defamation, the plaintiff must prove on a balance of probabilities
that the defamatory words were published, that is, that they were “communicated
to at least one person other than the plaintiff” (Grant v. Torstar Corp.,
2009 SCC 61, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 640, at para. 28). [2]                             
A hyperlink is a device
routinely used in articles on the Internet whereby a word or phrase is
identified, often with underlining, as being a portal to additional, related
information.  Clicking on the hyperlink connects the reader to that
information. [3]                             
The legal issue in this
appeal is whether hyperlinks that connect to allegedly defamatory material can
be said to “publish” that material. I.       Background [4]                             
Wayne Crookes is the
President and sole shareholder of West Coast Title Search Ltd.  He brought a
series of lawsuits against those he claimed were responsible for allegedly
defamatory articles published on a number of websites, arguing that the
articles represented a “smear campaign” against him and other members of the
Green Party of Canada. [5]                             
Jon Newton owns and
operates a website in British Columbia containing commentary about various
issues, including free speech and the Internet.  One of the articles he posted
on it was called “Free Speech in Canada”.  The article contained hyperlinks to
other websites, which in turn contained information about Mr. Crookes. [6]                             
Mr. Crookes sued Mr.
Newton on the basis that two of the hyperlinks he created connected to
defamatory material, and that by using those hyperlinks, Mr. Newton was
publishing the defamatory information.  One was a “shallow” hyperlink, which
takes the reader to a webpage where articles are posted, and the other was a
“deep” hyperlink, which takes the reader directly to an article (Matthew
Collins, The Law of Defamation and the Internet (3rd ed. 2010), at para.
2.43).  Both shallow and deep hyperlinks require the reader to click on the
link in order to be taken to the content. [7]                             
The two hyperlinks,
identified by underlining, were in the following excerpt from Mr. Newton’s
posting:                     Under new developments, . . . I’ve just met
Michael Pilling, who runs OpenPolitics.ca.  Based in Toronto, he,
too, is being sued for defamation. This time by politician Wayne Crookes.                     We’ve
decided to pool some of our resources to focus more attention on the appalling
state of Canada’s ancient and decrepit defamation laws and tomorrow, p2pnet
will run a post from Mike [Pilling] on his troubles. He and I will also be
releasing a joint press statement in the very near future. [A.R., at p. 125] [8]                             
OpenPolitics.ca was hyperlinked to the Open Politics
website where several articles were posted and were said by Mr. Crookes to be
defamatory.  Wayne Crookes was hyperlinked to an allegedly defamatory
article called “Wayne Crookes”, published anonymously on the website
www.USGovernetics.com. [9]                             
Mr. Crookes wrote to
Mr. Newton asking him to remove the two hyperlinks.  When he got no response,
Mr. Crookes’ lawyer wrote to Mr. Newton, repeating the request.  Mr. Newton
refused to remove the hyperlinks. [10]                         
Mr. Crookes sued Mr.
Newton for defamation in British Columbia.  He did not allege that anything on
Mr. Newton’s webpage was itself defamatory.  Rather, he argued that by creating
hyperlinks to the allegedly defamatory articles, or by refusing to remove those
hyperlinks when told of their defamatory character, Mr. Newton himself became a
publisher of the articles.  By then, Mr. Newton’s article had been
“viewed” 1,788 times.  There is no information in the record about whether, or
how many times, the hyperlinks themselves had been clicked on or followed. [11]                         
At trial, Kelleher J.
concluded that the mere creation of a hyperlink in a website does not lead to a
presumption that someone actually used the hyperlink to access the impugned
words (2008 BCSC 1424, 88 B.C.L.R. (4th) 395).  He agreed with Mr. Newton’s
submission that hyperlinks were analogous to footnotes since they only refer to
another source without repeating it.  Since there was no repetition, there was
no publication.  And in the absence of evidence that anyone other than Mr.
Crookes used the links and read the words to which they linked, there could not
be a finding of publication. [12]                         
In the Court of Appeal,
Saunders J.A., with whom Bauman J.A. concurred, held that the appeal should be
dismissed (2009 BCCA 392, 96 B.C.L.R. (4th) 315).  Agreeing with the trial
judge, she found that reference to an article containing defamatory comments
without repetition of the comments themselves is analogous to a footnote or a
card index in a library and should not be found to constitute republication of
the defamation.  While some words in an article may suggest that a particular
hyperlink is an “encouragement or invitation” to view the impugned site, she
saw no such encouragement or invitation in this case.  She also refused to
accept that the number of “hits” on the article itself was a sufficient basis
for drawing an inference that a third party had read the defamatory words
(paras. 89 and 92). [13]                         
Prowse J.A. dissented. 
While she agreed that the mere fact that Mr. Newton had created hyperlinks to
the impugned sites did not make him a publisher of the material found at the hyperlinked
sites, she did not accept the “footnote analogy” as being dispositive of the
publication issue (para. 60).  In her view, the fact that Mr. Newton’s website
had been viewed 1,788 times made it “unlikely” that no one had followed the
hyperlinks and read the impugned articles (para. 70).  Moreover, the context of
Mr. Newton’s article suggests that readers were in fact encouraged or invited
to click on the links.  In her view, therefore, there was publication. [14]                         
In British Columbia,
pursuant to the Libel and Slander Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 263,
publication is deemed to have occurred in certain situations.  There is,
however, no such presumption in relation to material published on the
Internet.  Nonetheless, Mr. Crookes argued that when a hyperlink has been
inserted on a webpage, it should be presumed that the content to which
the hyperlink connects has been brought to the knowledge of a third party and
has therefore been published.  For the reasons that follow, I would not only
reject such a presumption, I would conclude that a hyperlink, by itself, should
never be seen as “publication” of the content to which it refers. [15]                         
Mr. Crookes also
complains that the Court of Appeal imposed too high a burden of proof,
essentially requiring direct evidence that a third party followed the hyperlink
to the allegedly defamatory content.  This, he claims, deprives him of the
ability to rely on an inference that at least one person followed one of the
impugned hyperlinks to the allegedly defamatory content, and that the defamatory
meaning has therefore been published. (See Gaskin v. Retail Credit Co.,
[1965] S.C.R. 297.)  In view of my conclusion that hyperlinking is not, in and
of itself, publication, there is no need to address this argument. II.      Analysis [16]                         
To prove the publication
element of defamation, a plaintiff must establish that the defendant has, by
any act, conveyed defamatory meaning to a single third party who has
received it (McNichol v. Grandy, [1931] S.C.R. 696, at p. 699). 
Traditionally, the form the defendant’s act takes and the manner in which it
assists in causing the defamatory content to reach the third party are
irrelevant:                           There
are no limitations on the manner in which defamatory matter may be published. 
Any act which has the effect of transferring the defamatory information to a
third person constitutes a publication.                      (Stanley
v. Shaw, 2006 BCCA 467, 231 B.C.A.C. 186, at para. 5, citing Raymond E.
Brown, The Law of Defamation in Canada (2nd ed.), vol. 1, at No. 7.3.) See
also Hiltz and Seamone Co. v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General) (1997), 164
N.S.R. (2d) 161 (S.C.), at para. 21, aff’d in part (1999), 173 N.S.R. (2d) 341
(C.A.); Grant, at para. 119; “Truth” (N.Z.) Ltd. v. Holloway,
[1960] 1 W.L.R. 997 (P.C.); Lambert v. Thomson, [1937] O.R. 341 (C.A.), per
Rowell C.J.O.; Pullman v. Walter Hill & Co., [1891] 1 Q.B. 524
(C.A.), at p. 527, per Lord Esher M.R. [17]                         
Mr. Crookes argues
that, under this definition, a person who includes a hyperlink on a webpage has
“published” any defamatory remarks to which the hyperlink leads, because that
person has done an act which “has the effect of transferring the defamatory
information” to any third person who clicks on the link. [18]                         
Under this sole
disseminator/sole reader paradigm, the breadth of activity captured by the
traditional publication rule is vast.  In R. v. Clerk (1728), 1 Barn.
K.B. 304, 94 E.R. 207, for example, a printer’s servant, whose only role in an
act of publication was to “clap down” the printing press, was found responsible
for the libels contained in that publication, despite the fact that he was not
aware of the contents (p. 207).  In Hird v. Wood (1894), 38 S.J. 234
(C.A.), pointing at a sign displaying defamatory words was held to be evidence
of publication.  Other cases have also held that acts merely facilitating
communication can amount to publication: see, e.g., Buchanan v. Jennings,
[2004] UKPC 36, [2005] 1 A.C. 115; Polson v. Davis, 635 F.Supp. 1130 (D.
Kan. 1986), aff’d 895 F.2d 705 (10th Cir. 1990); Crain v. Lightner, 364
S.E.2d 778 (W. Va. 1987), at p. 785; and Spike v. Golding (1895), 27
N.S.R. 370 (S.C. in banco).  And in McNichol v. Grandy, the
defendant was found to be liable when he raised his voice and made defamatory
statements that were overheard by someone in another room. [19]                         
The publication rule
has also captured the following range of conduct:                     [The defamatory meaning] may be communicated
directly by the defendant either orally, or in some written or printed form, or
by way of a symbolic ceremony, dramatic pantomime, mime, brochure, gesture,
handbill, letter, photograph, placard, poster, sign, or cartoon.  It may be
inscribed on a blackboard, posted on a mirror or a telephone pole, or placed on
the wall of a building or the gable wall of the defendant’s property, or on the
front of a cheque, or entered in a database, or accessed on or downloaded from
a website on the internet.  It may appear on an ariel banner flown behind an
airplane, or someone’s attention may be drawn by the defendant to a poster, or
a defamatory writing already in circulation.  A third person may be given
access to defamatory material, or defamatory matter may be left in a place
where others can see it, or the defendant may request others to go to a place
where the defamatory information is available to see and read it, or it may be
set into motion as a result of the defendant’s death.  In each case there is a
publication.  [Footnotes omitted.]                     (Raymond
E. Brown, Brown on Defamation (2nd ed. (loose-leaf)), at para. 7.3) [20]                         
Defendants obtained
some relief from the rule’s significant breadth with the development of the
“innocent dissemination” defence, which protects “those who play a secondary
role in the distribution system, such as news agents, booksellers, and
libraries”:  Allen M. Linden and Bruce Feldthusen, Canadian Tort Law
(8th ed. 2006), at pp. 783-84; see also Society of Composers, Authors and
Music Publishers of Canada v. Canadian Assn. of Internet Providers, 2004
SCC 45, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 427 (“SOCAN”), at para. 89; Philip H. Osborne, The
Law of Torts (4th ed. 2011), at p. 411.  Such “subordinate distributors”
may escape liability by showing that they “have no actual knowledge of an
alleged libel, are aware of no circumstances to put them on notice to suspect a
libel, and committed no negligence in failing to find out about the libel” (SOCAN,
at para. 89; Vizetelly v. Mudie’s Select Library, Ltd., [1900] 2 Q.B.
170 (C.A.), at p. 180;  Brown, at para. 7.12(6)(c); and also Sun Life
Assurance Co. of Canada v. W. H. Smith and Son Ltd. (1934), 150 L.T. 211
(C.A.), at pp. 212-14). [21]                         
Recently, jurisprudence
has emerged suggesting that some acts are so passive that they should not be
held to be publication.  In Bunt v. Tilley, [2006] EWHC 407, [2006] 3
All E.R. 336 (Q.B.), considering the potential liability of an Internet service
provider, the court held that in order to hold someone liable as a publisher,
“[i]t is not enough that a person merely plays a passive instrumental role in
the process”; there must be “knowing involvement in the process of publication
of the relevant words” (para. 23 (emphasis in original); see also Metropolitan
International Schools Ltd. v. Designtechnica Corpn., [2009] EWHC 1765,
[2011] 1 W.L.R. 1743 (Q.B.)). [22]                         
Acknowledging these
developments, the question on this appeal is whether a simple reference — like
a hyperlink — to defamatory information is the type of act that can constitute
publication.  Some helpful guidance on this point is available in two American
cases.  In Klein v. Biben, 296 N.Y. 638 (1946), the New York Court of
Appeals decided that a statement saying “For more details about [the
plaintiff], see the Washington News Letter in The American Hebrew, May 12,
1944” (p. 639) was not a republication of the May 12 libel. [23]                         
And in MacFadden v.
Anthony, 117 N.Y.S.2d 520 (Sup. Ct. 1952), a complaint of defamation was
dismissed in a case where a radio host “called attention to [an allegedly
defamatory] article in Collier’s Magazine” (p. 521).  Relying on Klein,
the court concluded that referring to the article was neither a republication
nor a publication of the libel. [24]                         
These cases were relied
on in Carter v. B.C. Federation of Foster Parents Assn., 2005 BCCA 398,
42 B.C.L.R. (4th) 1, where the plaintiff alleged that, by mentioning the
Internet address of an online discussion forum, the publisher of a newsletter
was responsible for republishing defamatory comments published on that site. 
Relying on MacFadden and Klein for the proposition that
“reference to an article containing defamatory comment without repetition of
the comment itself should not be found to be a republication of such defamatory
comment” (para. 12), Hall J.A. held that there was no publication. [25]                         
I agree with this
approach.  It avoids a formalistic application of the traditional publication
rule and recognizes the importance of the communicative and expressive function
in referring to other sources.  Applying such a rule to hyperlinks, as the
reasons of Justice Deschamps demonstrate, has the effect of creating a
presumption of liability for all hyperlinkers, an untenable situation in my
view. [26]                         
A reference to other
content is fundamentally different from other acts involved in publication. 
Referencing on its own does not involve exerting control over the
content.  Communicating something is very different from merely communicating
that something exists or where it exists.  The former involves dissemination of
the content, and suggests control over both the content and whether the content
will reach an audience at all, while the latter does not.  Even where the goal
of the person referring to a defamatory publication is to expand that
publication’s audience, his or her participation is merely ancillary to that of
the initial publisher: with or without the reference, the allegedly defamatory
information has already been made available to the public by the initial
publisher or publishers’ acts.  These features of references distinguish them
from acts in the publication process like creating or posting the defamatory
publication, and from repetition. [27]                         
Hyperlinks are, in
essence, references.  By clicking on the link, readers are directed to other
sources.  Hyperlinks may be inserted with or without the knowledge of the
operator of the site containing the secondary article.  Because the content of
the secondary article is often produced by someone other than the person who
inserted the hyperlink in the primary article, the content on the other end of
the link can be changed at any time by whoever controls the secondary page. 
Although the primary author controls whether there is a hyperlink and what
article that word or phrase is linked to, inserting a hyperlink gives the
primary author no control over the content in the secondary article to which he
or she has linked.  (See David Lindsay, Liability for the Publication of Defamatory
Material via the Internet (2000), at pp. 14 and 78-79; Collins, at paras.
2.42 to 2.43 and 5.42.) [28]                         
These features — that a
person who refers to other content generally does not participate in its creation
or development — serve to insulate from liability those involved
in Internet communications in the United States: see Communications Decency
Act of 1996, 47 U.S.C. §230 (1996); see also Jack M. Balkin, “The
Future of Free Expression in a Digital Age” (2009), 36 Pepp. L. Rev.
427, at pp. 433-34; Zeran v. America Online, Inc., 129 F.3d 327 (4th
Cir. 1997); Barrett v. Rosenthal, 146 P.3d 510 (Cal. 2006); Fair
Housing Council of San Fernando Valley v. Roommates.Com, LLC, 521 F.3d 1157
(9th Cir. 2008). [29]                         
Although the person
selecting the content to which he or she wants to link might facilitate
the transfer of information (a traditional hallmark of publication), it is
equally clear that when a person follows a link they are leaving one source and
moving to another.  In my view, then, it is the actual creator or poster of the
defamatory words in the secondary material who is publishing the libel when a
person follows a hyperlink to that content.  The ease with which the referenced
content can be accessed does not change the fact that, by hyperlinking, an individual
is referring the reader to other content.  (See Dell Computer Corp. v. Union
des consommateurs, 2007 SCC 34, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 801, at paras. 97-102.) [30]                         
Hyperlinks thus share
the same relationship with the content to which they refer as do references.  Both
communicate that something exists, but do not, by themselves, communicate its
content.  And they both require some act on the part of a third party before he
or she gains access to the content.  The fact that access to that content is
far easier with hyperlinks than with footnotes does not change the reality that
a hyperlink, by itself, is content-neutral — it expresses no opinion, nor does
it have any control over, the content to which it refers. [31]                         
This interpretation of
the publication rule better accords with our Court’s recent jurisprudence on
defamation law.  This Court has recognized that what is at stake in an action
for defamation is not only an individual’s interest in protecting his or her
reputation, but also the public’s interest in protecting freedom of expression:
Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1130. [32]                         
Pre-Charter approaches
to defamation law in Canada largely leaned towards protecting reputation.  That
began to change when the Court modified the “honest belief” element to the fair
comment defence in WIC Radio Ltd. v. Simpson, 2008 SCC 40, [2008] 2
S.C.R. 420, and when, in Grant, the Court developed a defence of
responsible communication on matters of public interest.  These cases recognize
the importance of achieving a proper balance between protecting an individual’s
reputation and the foundational role of freedom of expression in the
development of democratic institutions and values (Grant, at para. 1; Hill,
at para. 101). [33]                         
Interpreting the
publication rule to exclude mere references not only accords with a more
sophisticated appreciation of Charter values, but also with the dramatic
transformation in the technology of communications.  See June Ross, “The Common
Law of Defamation Fails to Enter the Age of the Charter” (1996), 35 Alta.
L. Rev. 117; see also Jeremy Streeter, “The ‘Deception Exception’: A New
Approach to Section 2(b) Values and Its Impact on Defamation Law” (2003), 61 U.T.

Reputation in the Common Law of Defamation” (1996-1997), 22 Queen’s L.J.

Expression in Cases of Internet Defamation” (2010), 56 McGill L.J. 1;

Privacy in the Context of Global Communications Technology” (1999), 48 U.N.B.L.J.
189; Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U.S. 844 (1997), at p.
870. [34]                         
The Internet’s capacity
to disseminate information has been described by this Court as “one of the great
innovations of the information age” whose “use should be facilitated rather
than discouraged” (SOCAN, at para. 40, per Binnie J.). 
Hyperlinks, in particular, are an indispensable part of its operation.  As
Matthew Collins explains, at para. 5.42:                     Hyperlinks
are the synapses connecting different parts of the world wide web.  Without
hyperlinks, the web would be like a library without a catalogue: full of
information, but with no sure means of finding it. (See
also Lindsay, at pp. 78-79; Mark Sableman, “Link Law Revisited: Internet
Linking Law at Five Years” (2001), 16 Berkeley Tech. L.J. 1273, at p.
1276.) [35]                         
The centrality of the
role of hyperlinks in facilitating access to information on the Internet was
also compellingly explained by Anjali Dalal in “Protecting Hyperlinks and
Preserving First Amendment Values on the Internet” (2011), 13 U. Pa. J.
Const. L. 1017:                                      Hyperlinks have long been
understood to be critical to communication because they facilitate
access to information.  They provide visitors on one website a way to navigate
to internally referenced words, phrases, arguments, and ideas.  Under this
view, if the Internet is an endless expanse of information where “any person .
. . . can become a pamphleteer” then “[h]yperlinks are the paths among
websites, creating the bustling street corners for distribution of those
pamphlets and inviting passersby to engage more deeply with the issues raised.” . . .                                      .
. . While the concerns motivating cases brought against hyperlinks are often
legitimate, limiting the use of links poses a significant danger to
communication and future innovation. [Emphasis in original; footnotes omitted;
pp. 1019 and 1022.] [36]                         
The Internet cannot, in
short, provide access to information without hyperlinks.  Limiting their
usefulness by subjecting them to the traditional publication rule would have
the effect of seriously restricting the flow of information and, as a result,
freedom of expression.  The potential “chill” in how the Internet functions
could be devastating, since primary article authors would unlikely want to risk
liability for linking to another article over whose changeable content they
have no control.  Given the core significance of the role of hyperlinking to
the Internet, we risk impairing its whole functioning.  Strict application of
the publication rule in these circumstances would be like trying to fit a
square archaic peg into the hexagonal hole of modernity. [37]                         
I do not for a moment
wish to minimize the potentially harmful impacts of defamatory speech on the
Internet.  Nor do I resile from asserting that individuals’ reputations are
entitled to vigorous protection from defamatory comments.  It is clear that
“the right to free expression does not confer a licence to ruin reputations” (Grant,
at para. 58).  Because the Internet is a powerful medium for all
kinds of expression, it is also a potentially powerful vehicle for expression
that is defamatory.  In Barrick Gold
Corp. v. Lopehandia (2004), 71 O.R. (3d) 416 (C.A.), at para. 32,
Blair J.A. recognized the Internet’s “tremendous power” to harm reputation,
citing with approval the following excerpt from Lyrissa Barnett Lidsky, “Silencing John Doe:
Defamation & Discourse in Cyberspace” (2000), 49 Duke L.J. 855, at
pp. 863-64:                             Although
Internet communications may have the ephemeral qualities of gossip with regard
to accuracy, they are communicated through a medium more pervasive than print,
and for this reason they have tremendous power to harm reputation.  Once a
message enters cyberspace, millions of people worldwide can gain access to it. 
Even if the message is posted in a discussion forum frequented by only a
handful of people, any one of them can republish the message by printing it or,
as is more likely, by forwarding it instantly to a different discussion forum. 
And if the message is sufficiently provocative, it may be republished again and
again.  The extraordinary capacity of the Internet to replicate almost endlessly
any defamatory message lends credence to the notion that “the truth rarely
catches up with a lie”.  The problem for libel law, then, is how to protect
reputation without squelching the potential of the Internet as a medium of
public discourse. [Blair J.A.’s emphasis deleted.] [38]                         
New activities on the
Internet and the greater potential for anonymity amplify even further the ease
with which a reputation can be harmed online:                     The rapid expansion of the Internet coupled with
the surging popularity of social networking services like Facebook and Twitter
has created a situation where everyone is a potential publisher, including
those unfamiliar with defamation law.  A reputation can be destroyed in the
click of a mouse, an anonymous email or an ill-timed Tweet.                     (Bryan
G. Baynham, Q.C., and Daniel J. Reid, “The Modern-Day Soapbox: Defamation in
the Age of the Internet”, in Defamation Law: Materials prepared for the
Continuing Legal Education seminar, Defamation Law 2010 (2010), at p.
3.1.1) [39]                         
But I am not persuaded that
exposing mere hyperlinks to the traditional publication rule ultimately
protects reputation.  A publication is defamatory if it both refers to the
plaintiff and conveys a defamatory meaning: Grant, at para. 28.  These
inquiries depend, respectively, on whether the words used or “the circumstances
attending the publication are such as[] would lead reasonable persons to
understand that it was the plaintiff to whom the defendant referred” (Brown, at
para. 6.1), and whether the words would “ten[d] to lower a person in the
estimation of right-thinking members of society” (Botiuk v. Toronto Free
Press Publications Ltd., [1995] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 62).  Defamatory
meaning in the words may be discerned from “all the circumstances of the case,
including any reasonable implications the words may bear, the context in which
the words are used, the audience to whom they were published and the manner in
which they were presented” (Botiuk, at para. 62, citing Brown (2nd ed.
1994), at p. 1-15).  (See Brown, at paras. 5.2, 5.4(1)(a) and 6.1; Knupffer
v. London Express Newspaper, Ltd., [1944] A.C. 116 (H.L.); Butler v.
Southam Inc., 2001 NSCA 121, 197 N.S.R. (2d) 97; Bou Malhab v.
Diffusion Métromédia CMR inc., 2011
SCC 9, [2011] 1 S.C.R. 214, at
paras. 63 and 112.) [40]                         
Where a defendant uses a reference
in a manner that in itself conveys defamatory meaning about the
plaintiff, the plaintiff’s ability to vindicate his or her reputation depends
on having access to a remedy against that defendant.  In this way, individuals may attract liability for
hyperlinking if the manner in which they have referred to content conveys
defamatory meaning; not because they have created a reference, but because,
understood in context, they have actually expressed something defamatory
(Collins, at paras. 7.06 to 7.08 and 8.20 to 8.21). This might be found to occur, for example, where a person places a
reference in a text that repeats defamatory content from a secondary source (Carter,
at para. 12). [41]                         
 Preventing plaintiffs
from suing those who have merely referred their readers to other sources that
may contain defamatory content and not expressed defamatory meaning about the
plaintiffs will not leave them unable to vindicate their reputations.  As
previously noted, when a hyperlinker
creates a link, he or she gains no control over the content linked to.  If a
plaintiff wishes to prevent further publications of the defamatory content, his
or her most effective remedy lies with the person who actually created and
controls the content. [42]                         
  Making reference to
the existence and/or location of content by hyperlink or otherwise, without
more, is not publication of that content.  Only when a hyperlinker presents
content from the hyperlinked material in a way that actually repeats the
defamatory content, should that content be considered to be “published” by the
hyperlinker.  Such an approach promotes expression and respects the realities
of the Internet, while creating little or no limitations to a plaintiff’s
ability to vindicate his or her reputation.  While a mere reference to another
source should not fall under the wide breadth of the traditional publication
rule, the rule itself and the limits of the one writer/any act/one reader
paradigm may deserve further scrutiny in the future. [43]                         
I am aware that
distinctions can be drawn between hyperlinks, such as the deep and shallow
hyperlinks at issue in this case, and links that automatically display other
content. The reality of the Internet means that we are dealing with the
inherent and inexorable fluidity of evolving technologies.  As a result, it
strikes me as unwise in these reasons to attempt to anticipate, let alone
comprehensively address, the legal implications of the varieties of links that
are or may become available.  Embedded or automatic links, for example, may
well prove to be of consequence in future cases, but these differences were not
argued in this case or addressed in the courts below, and therefore need not be
addressed here. III.    Application [44]                         
Nothing on Mr. Newton’s
page is itself alleged to be defamatory.  The impugned conduct in this case is
Mr. Newton’s insertion of hyperlinks on his webpage.  Mr. Crookes’ argument is
that by linking to webpages and websites containing allegedly defamatory
content, Mr. Newton has published that defamatory content.  Since in my view
the use of a hyperlink cannot, by itself, amount to publication even if the
hyperlink is followed and the defamatory content is accessed, Mr. Crookes’
action against Mr. Newton cannot succeed.  Moreover, even if Mr. Crookes had
alleged that Mr. Newton should be understood, in context, to have expressed
defamatory meaning, I would agree with the trial judge and the majority of the
Court of Appeal that the statements containing the impugned hyperlinks on Mr.
Newton’s page could not be understood, even in context with the hyperlinked
documents, to express any opinion — defamatory or otherwise — on Mr. Crookes or
the hyperlinked content. [45]                         
I would dismiss the
appeal with costs.                     The
following are the reasons delivered by [46]                         
The Chief
Justice and Fish J. — We have read the reasons
of Deschamps J. and Abella J.  While we agree in large part with the reasons of
Abella J., we respectfully propose a different formulation of the test for when
a hyperlink reference in a text constitutes publication of defamatory matter to
which it links. [47]                         
The question, in legal terms, is when inclusion of a hyperlink in
a text constitutes publication of a defamation in the hyperlinked material. 
Abella J. states that “a hyperlink, by itself, should never be seen as
‘publication’ of the content to which it refers” (para. 14). As justification,
she notes that the hyperlinker has no control over the content referred to; the
hyperlinker is not the creator of the content, and the content of the page
linked to may change at any time (paras. 26-27).  A hyperlink, therefore, is a
reference and references are by definition “content-neutral” (para. 30). [48]                         
Abella J. concludes that “[o]nly when a hyperlinker presents
content from the hyperlinked material in a way that actually repeats the
defamatory content, should that content be considered to be ‘published’ by the
hyperlinker” (para. 42).  In our view, the combined text and hyperlink may
amount to publication of defamatory material in the hyperlink in some
circumstances.  Publication of a defamatory statement via a hyperlink should be
found if the text indicates adoption or endorsement of the content of the
hyperlinked text.  If the text communicates agreement with the content
linked to, then the hyperlinker should be liable for the defamatory content. 
The defendant must adopt or endorse the defamatory words or material; a mere
general reference to a web site is not enough.  Thus, defendants linking
approvingly to an innocent Web site that later becomes defamatory would not be
liable. [49]                         
Finding publication in adoption or endorsement of the defamatory
material in a Web site is consistent with the general law of defamation.  In Hill
v. Church of Scientology of Toronto, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1130, at para.
176, this Court held:                     If one
person writes a libel, another repeats it, and a third approves what is
written, they all have made the defamatory libel.  Both the person who
originally utters the defamatory statement, and the individual who expresses
agreement with it, are liable for the injury. [50]                         
In sum, in our view, a hyperlink should constitute publication
if, read contextually, the text that includes the hyperlink constitutes
adoption or endorsement of the specific content it links to. [51]                         
It is true that the traditional publication rule does not require
the publisher to approve of the material published; he or she must merely
communicate that material to a third party.  However, the proposed adoption or
endorsement standard for references is conceptually different.  A mere
reference without any adoption or endorsement remains that — a content-neutral
reference.  Adoption or endorsement of the content accessible by a link in the
text can be understood to actually incorporate the defamatory content into the
text.  Thus, the content of the text comes to include the defamatory content
accessed via hyperlink. The hyperlink, combined with the surrounding words and
context, ceases to be a mere reference and the content to which it refers
becomes part of the published text itself. [52]                         
We add a final comment, with an eye to future technological
changes.  Abella J., as noted, states that “a hyperlink, by itself, should
never be seen as ‘publication’ of the content to which it refers” (para. 14). 
So long as it is necessary to click on a hyperlink to access its content, this
may be correct.  What, however, of features in which a hyperlink projects
content on the page automatically, or in a separate frame, with little or no
prompting from the reader?  Would inclusion of such a hyperlink, by itself,
amount to publication?  Like the issue of embedded hyperlinks, this question is
not before us and should not be taken to have been decided in this case.  Like
Abella J. (at para. 43), we would leave issues concerning hyperlinks of this
sort to be dealt with if and when they arise. [53]                         
We agree with Abella J. that this appeal should be dismissed with
costs.                     The
following are the reasons delivered by [54]                         
Deschamps J. — This appeal offers yet another opportunity for the Court to
consider the proper balance in the common law of defamation between the
protection of reputation and the promotion of freedom of expression. In WIC
Radio Ltd. v. Simpson, 2008 SCC 40, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 420, and Grant v.
Torstar Corp., 2009 SCC 61, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 640, the Court took incremental
steps to improve this balance by recognizing and modernizing defences to
liability for defamation. In the instant case, the Court must determine
whether, notwithstanding these defences, the scope of conduct that may attract prima
facie liability for defamation is itself too broad and in need of
adjustment to further promote freedom of expression. [55]                         
Proof of publication is necessary in order to
establish liability for defamation. “Publication” has an established meaning in
the law of defamation. It refers to the communication of defamatory information
in such a way that it is “made known to a third party”: Gaskin v. Retail
Credit Co., [1965] S.C.R. 297, at p. 299. Professor Brown explains that
“[i]t is a bilateral act by which the publisher makes available to a
reader, listener or observer in a comprehensible form the defamatory
information” (R. E. Brown, Brown on Defamation
(2nd ed. (loose-leaf)), at para. 7.2). Thus, publication
has two components: (1) an act that makes the defamatory information available
to a third party in a comprehensible form, and (2) the receipt of the
information by a third party in such a way that it is understood. [56]                         
The question is whether the first component of
publication needs to be reconsidered owing to the impact of new forms of
communications media. In answering this question, it will of course be
necessary to bear in mind the particular technological feature — the Internet
hyperlink — at issue in the case at bar. At the same time, however, the answer
must be adaptable to other modes of communication and to future technological
change. [57]                         
I have read the reasons of my colleague Abella
J. It is her view that the concept of publication as understood at common law
needs to be altered so as to exclude references, including hyperlinks, from its
scope. No longer must a reference, like any other act, simply make the
defamatory information available in a comprehensible form: “Only when a
hyperlinker presents content from the hyperlinked material in a way that
actually repeats the defamatory content, should that content be considered to
be ‘published’ by the hyperlinker” (para. 42). With respect, I disagree with
this approach. I have also read the reasons of the Chief Justice and Fish J.
They purport to approve Abella J.’s approach but, in effect, find that there
are circumstances in which hyperlinked information can lead to a finding of
publication. In so doing, they depart from the bright-line rule proposed by
Abella J. In order to give guidance, I would prefer to outline a rule that is
consistent with the common law and the civil law of defamation and that will
also accommodate future developments in Internet law. [58]                         
To create a specifically Canadian exception for
references, which has the effect of excluding hyperlinks from the scope of the
publication rule, is in my view an inadequate solution to the novel issues
raised by the Internet. On the one hand, this blanket exclusion exaggerates the
difference between references and other acts of publication. On the other hand,
it treats all references, from footnotes to hyperlinks, alike. In so doing, it
disregards the fact that references vary greatly in how they make defamatory
information available to third parties and, consequently, in the harm they can
cause to people’s reputations. [59]                         
A more nuanced approach to revising the publication rule, and one
that can be applied effectively to new media, would be for the Court to hold
that in Canadian law, a reference to defamatory content can satisfy the
requirements of the first component of publication if it makes the defamatory
information readily available to a third party in a comprehensible form.
In addition, the Court should make it clear that not every act, but only deliberate
acts, can lead to liability for defamation. [60]                         
Freedom of expression must be reconciled with the “equally
important” right to reputation: Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto,
[1995] 2 S.C.R. 1130, at para. 121. Unlike my colleague Abella J.’s approach,
the one I propose gives due weight to freedom of expression yet at the same
time is grounded in a recognition that even simple references to defamatory
information can significantly harm a person’s reputation. It would enable
individuals whose reputations are so harmed to seek relief from those who,
through deliberate acts, make defamatory material readily available to third
parties. [61]                         
If the person who made the reference was unaware that the
information referred to was defamatory, the defence of innocent dissemination
may be available: Society of Composers, Authors and Music
Publishers of Canada v. Canadian Assn. of Internet Providers, 2004 SCC 45, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 427 (“SOCAN”), at para. 89.
In addition, as the Court mentioned in WIC and Grant, defences
such as fair comment and reasonable communication on matters of public interest
are also available. With respect, a shortcoming in my colleague’s approach is
that she fails to consider the law of defamation generally, and instead focuses
narrowly on one aspect of the rules governing publication. The result is
problematically one-sided, as individuals who suffer harm to their reputations
are left with no recourse against those who perpetuate defamatory information. [62]                         
A reference, devoid of context, has never amounted in law to
publication of the information to which it directs the third party. To so hold
would be to disregard the bilateral nature of publication. Publication is not
complete until someone other than the person referred to receives and understands
the defamatory information. Thus, “to shout aloud defamatory words on a desert
moor where no one hears them, is not a publication” (Gambrill v. Schooley,
93 Md. 48 (1901), at p. 60). In the context of the Internet, a simple
reference, absent evidence that someone actually viewed and understood the
defamatory information to which it directs third parties, is not publication of
that content. [63]                         
In the instant case, the respondent, Jon Newton, admits that he
hyperlinked to information that the appellants, Wayne Crookes and West Coast
Title Search Ltd., allege to be defamatory. In the circumstances, Mr. Newton
acted as more than a mere conduit in making the hyperlinked information
available. His action was deliberate. Inasmuch as one link made the allegedly
defamatory material readily available, the requirements of the first component
of publication are satisfied for that link. However, publication is not
complete unless the plaintiff adduces evidence that satisfies, on a balance of
probabilities, the requirements of the second component of publication: that a
third party received and understood the information to which reference is made.
I agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal that the evidence adduced with
respect to the second component of publication is insufficient in this case. I
would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs and add that Mr. Newton might
also have been able to raise defences to liability for defamation. I.             
Background [64]                         
Two broad types of hyperlinks can be found on
Web pages. The first and most common is an ordinary link. It is always
user-activated: the Internet user clicks on a link on a Web page and is
transferred to another page. The second type, which is often automatic but can
also be user-activated, is created by a process referred to as “framing”.
Unlike with ordinary links, in the case of framing, the Internet user does not
leave the original Web page: information from another Web page appears in a
“frame” on the page already accessed by the user. Where the framing is automatic,
the content of other pages appears simultaneously in a frame when the user
accesses the primary page. Moreover, a hyperlink can be either a “shallow” link
to a site’s home page or a “deep” link to a page located on that site or
another site. Both types of hyperlinks, as well as the distinction between
shallow and deep links, have previously been referred to by the Court (SOCAN;
Dell Computer Corp. v. Union des
consommateurs, 2007 SCC 34, [2007] 2
S.C.R. 801, at para. 4; and see, generally, M. Collins, The Law of
Defamation and the Internet (3rd ed. 2010), at para. 2.43). In addition to
Web pages, a variety of other forms of Internet communications can contain
hyperlinks, including e-mail messages and on-line fora. In these reasons, the
terms “hyperlink” and “link” will, unless otherwise specified, be used to refer
to user-activated hyperlinks. [65]                         
On July 18, 2006, Mr. Newton
published an article on his Web site. It was entitled “Free Speech in Canada”
and contained the following passage:                     Under new developments, thanks to the lawsuit,
I’ve just met Michael Pilling, who runs OpenPolitics.ca. Based in
Toronto, he, too, is being sued for defamation. This time by politician Wayne
Crookes.                     We’ve decided to pool some of our resources to
focus more attention on the appalling state of Canada’s ancient and decrepit
defamation laws and tomorrow, p2pnet will run a post from Mike on his troubles.
He and I will also be releasing a joint press statement in the very near
future. [A.R., at p. 125] [66]                         
The underlined text in this passage constituted hyperlinks, which
Mr. Newton admits he created. The evidence indicates that “OpenPolitics.ca”
was a shallow link to the Web site in question, on which, Mr. Crookes alleges,
several interlinked articles defaming him could be found. The evidence further
indicates that “Wayne Crookes” was a deep link to an article on another
Web site, www.USGovernetics.com, that Mr. Crookes also alleges to be
defamatory. These impugned hyperlinks were among seven different links contained
in Mr. Newton’s article and were both preceded and followed by other
hyperlinks. All the hyperlinks and the information to which they referred the
user could be accessed by the public on line without restrictions. [67]                         
On August 18, 2006, Mr. Crookes wrote to Mr.
Newton and demanded that the hyperlinks “OpenPolitics.ca” and “Wayne
Crookes” be removed. He received no response. On October 31, 2006, Mr.
Crookes’ lawyer wrote to Mr. Newton and demanded that the hyperlinks be
removed. On November 9, 2006, Mr. Newton refused to do so. In response to
interrogatories that were subsequently addressed to him, Mr. Newton offered the
following explanation for his refusal to remove the hyperlinks: “I saw no need.
It was merely a hyperlink” (A.R., at p. 186). [68]                         
As of February 1, 2008, the article “Free Speech
in Canada” had been accessed 1,788 times. There is no information in the record
on how many people — if any — read the allegedly defamatory material, or on
whether any person who may have viewed the material accessed it by clicking on
the two hyperlinks or by other means. The evidence is also silent on the
behaviour of Internet surfers with respect to hyperlinks, and on the
jurisdiction in which any individuals who may have read the hyperlinked
material reside. [69]                         
Mr. Crookes and his company, West Coast Title Search Ltd., sued
Mr. Newton for defamation in British Columbia. The parties
brought applications for summary trial and judgment under Rule 18A of the
British Columbia Supreme Court Rules, B.C. Reg. 221/90. Kelleher J. granted
Mr. Newton’s application and dismissed the action, finding that there had
been no publication (2008 BCSC 1424, 88 B.C.L.R. (4th) 395). [70]                         
Kelleher J. rejected Mr. Crookes’ contention
that publication by Mr. Newton of the allegedly defamatory material should
be presumed from the fact that he had created the hyperlinks. In the trial
judge’s view, the plaintiffs’ failure to adduce any evidence that people had
actually clicked on the hyperlinks and read the information was fatal to their
position (paras. 20 and 24). Kelleher J. also concluded that the circumstances
of the case did not support a finding of publication, drawing an analogy
between a hyperlink and a footnote or a reference to a Web site in printed
material (para. 29). Although the hyperlinks provided “immediate access to
material published on another website” (para. 30), they did not make Mr. Newton
a publisher of what readers would find if they chose to click on the link.
Kelleher J. endorsed the proposition of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in
Carter v. B.C. Federation of Foster Parents Assn., 2005 BCCA 398, 42
B.C.L.R. (4th) 1, that “reference to an article containing defamatory comment
without repetition of the comment itself should not be found to be a
republication of such defamatory [comment]” (para. 33). He cautioned, however,
that this did not mean that a hyperlink can never lead to liability for
defamation. If Mr. Newton had written “the truth about Wayne Crookes is found here”
and the word “here” was a hyperlink to defamatory information, Kelleher
J. might have concluded differently (para. 34). [71]                         
A majority of the British Columbia Court of
Appeal dismissed the appeal (2009 BCCA 392, 96 B.C.L.R. (4th) 315). The judges
were unanimous in rejecting Mr. Crookes’ argument that the creation of a
hyperlink leads to a presumption of publication of the information to which the
link points. Prowse J.A., who spoke for the court on this issue, noted that the
legislature had provided for a presumption of publication in the case of
broadcasts and newspapers, but not of the Internet (paras. 32-33). She was not
prepared to create such a presumption on the basis of the record before her,
and she expressed the opinion that this was a matter that might more
appropriately be determined by the legislature (para. 41). [72]                         
Saunders J.A. (Bauman J.A. concurring) wrote the
reasons of the majority on the issue of whether publication could be inferred
from the circumstances of the case. In her view, it could not. Accepting the
bilateral nature of publication, she found that the hyperlinks did not satisfy
the requirements of the first component of the definition of that term. She
relied on the same jurisprudence as Kelleher J. in support of the proposition
that merely referring to defamatory information without repeating it does not
constitute publication (para. 81, citing Carter; MacFadden v. Anthony,
117 N.Y.S.2d 520 (Sup. Ct. 1952); Klein v. Biben, 296 N.Y. 638 (1946)).
However, the circumstances of a case can demonstrate that a particular
hyperlink invited or encouraged a reader to view the hyperlinked site, or that
the information on that site was endorsed (para. 84). The majority held that
there were no such circumstances in the instant case and that the way Mr.
Newton presented the hyperlinks to potential users was “most comparable to a
footnote for a reader, or a card index in a library” (para. 89). On the second
component of publication, Saunders J.A. expressed the opinion that the bare
number of 1,788 hits on Mr. Newton’s article was insufficient to support an inference
that at least one person other than Mr. Crookes had clicked on the hyperlinks
and read the allegedly defamatory information (para. 92). [73]                         
Prowse J.A., dissenting, agreed with the
majority on the first component of publication, but held that the circumstances
of the case supported an inference that readers had been actively encouraged by
Mr. Newton to click on the hyperlinks. In other words, the hyperlinks were
being presented in such a way that they operated as more than simple footnotes.
Furthermore, on the second aspect of publication, Prowse J.A. was prepared to
infer that at least one person in British Columbia had clicked on the
hyperlinks and read the impugned information. As a result, she found that there
had been publication and stated that she would have allowed the appeal. II.      Positions of the Parties [74]                         
Mr. Crookes argues that there is a presumption
of publication whenever there are facts from which it can reasonably be
inferred that the allegedly defamatory information was brought to the knowledge
of some third person. Applying this proposition to hyperlinks, he contends that
given the “deliberateness, immediacy and facilitation of access [to
information]” that characterizes such links, the hyperlinked information should
be understood to have been incorporated into the Web page on which the links
were embedded. As a result, “[i]t can be reasonably inferred that embedding a
hyperlink in the primary article brings the contents of the hyperlinked
material to the knowledge of a third person [who accesses that article]” (A.F.,
at paras. 61-62). [75]                         
Building on these arguments, Mr. Crookes also
submits that the circumstances of this case would support an inference of
publication. He disputes the position of the majority of the Court of Appeal
that Mr. Newton’s hyperlink was comparable to a footnote, arguing that “[i]n
the present case the barrier to accessing the defamatory comment is attenuated.
All that is required is a keystroke” (A.F., at para. 75). He endorses Prowse
J.A.’s approach, supporting her finding that the context of Mr. Newton’s
hyperlinks, together with the 1,788 hits on Mr. Newton’s article, was
sufficient to support an inference that at least one of those who read the
article had clicked on the hyperlinks and read the allegedly defamatory information. [76]                         
As for Mr. Newton, he rejects the view that
publication should be presumed or inferred in the case of hyperlinks.
Furthermore, he supports the finding of Kelleher J. and of the majority of the
Court of Appeal that the evidence of 1,788 hits on his article was insufficient
to support a conclusion that readers of the article had actually clicked on the
hyperlink and read the allegedly defamatory information (R.F., at para. 35). [77]                         
More fundamentally, Mr. Newton’s position is
that hyperlinking does not constitute publication: a user-activated hyperlink
“involves no transmission, copying or presentation of the alleged defamation,
no control over its content, and no control over whether a reader makes the
choice to follow the hyperlink” (R.F., at para. 58). He disputes the view that
the fact that a hyperlink facilitates access to the linked information should
justify a finding of publication, since publication “only occurs when a message
is both posted and read” (para. 57). He also submits that, since any user-activated
hyperlink could to some degree be considered an “invitation” to click on the
link, it would be wrong to find that there was publication on the basis of such
an invitation. This submission, too, is based on the principle that publication
is not complete until the allegedly defamatory information is read. Finally,
the fact that the creation of a hyperlink was deliberate cannot in itself be
the basis for a finding of publication, since the question is “whether the
bilateral posting/reading test for publication is met, and the insertion of a
hyperlink alone does not meet either part of the test” (para. 85). III.    Positions of the Interveners [78]                         
The interveners in this appeal take divergent
approaches to when, if ever, a hyperlink could be said to constitute
publication of the information to which it refers. The approach of my colleague
Abella J. most closely resembles that of the Canadian Civil Liberties
Association, which argues that publication “should be reserved for those
situations where an individual actually communicates the allegedly defamatory
words” (Factum, at para. 52). The result my colleague reaches is also
consistent with the position taken by a group of interveners composed of print,
broadcast and Internet media organizations. They argue that hyperlinks should
never be equated with publication, because that would threaten the ability of
its members to compete and fulfil their mandates in the Internet age (Media
Coalition Factum, at paras. 42-43). [79]                         
Certain other interveners — the British Columbia
Civil Liberties Association (“BCCLA”), the Samuelson-Glushko Canadian Internet
Policy and Public Interest Clinic (“CIPPIC”), and NetCoalition — accept that
hyperlinking may constitute publication in appropriate circumstances, but seek
to restrict those circumstances to instances involving variants of knowledge or
explicit endorsement or adoption of linked information by the hyperlinker
(e.g., BCCLA Factum, at paras. 22 and 24; CIPPIC Factum, at para. 2;
NetCoalition Factum, at para. 4). CIPPIC takes this argument a step further,
submitting that a plaintiff must prove publication on “a convincing evidentiary
basis” (Factum, at para. 4). Finally, NetCoalition submits that, where a
hyperlinker has not explicitly endorsed defamatory information or where there
is no nexus between the hyperlink and such an endorsement, a defence of
innocent dissemination should be available (Factum, at para. 34). IV.    Analysis [80]                         
When a plaintiff seeks to establish prima facie liability
for defamation, the court must not only consider whether the impugned
information can reasonably be said to be defamatory and whether it in fact
refers to the plaintiff, but must also consider the question of publication to
a third party, bearing in mind the bilateral nature of publication. To be published,
defamatory words must be “communicated” (Grant, at para. 28).
“Communication” means that a message is both sent in a comprehensible form, and
received and understood. Publication does not occur until “the defamatory
matter is brought by the defendant or his agent to the knowledge and
understanding of some person other than the plaintiff” (McNichol v. Grandy,
[1931] S.C.R. 696, at p. 704, per Duff J. (as he then was); Brown, at
paras. 7.2 and 7.8; Gatley on Libel and Slander (11th ed. 2008), at p. 164). [81]                         
To determine whether an act can form the basis for a finding of
publication, it is first necessary to consider the nature of the act itself. [82]                         
Acts that may form the basis for a finding of publication and
which may ultimately attract liability for defamation have never been limited
to acts of the author or creator of the defamatory information. Rather, “[a]ll
those jointly responsible for the publication are liable. Liability extends to
all those who take part in the publication of the defamatory material,
including those who merely cause or procure it to be published” (Brown, at
para. 7.4 (footnotes omitted); Gatley on Libel and Slander, at p. 169; Lambert
v. Thomson, [1937] O.R. 341 (C.A.), at p. 344: “. . . where the libel is
published in a newspaper or book, everyone who takes part in publishing it or
in procuring its publication is prima facie liable”). As this Court
noted in Botiuk v. Toronto Free Press Publications Ltd., [1995] 3 S.C.R.
3, at para. 75, “the design or agreement of persons to participate in acts
which are tortious” is sufficient for them to be found liable for defamation as
joint concurrent tortfeasors even if “they did not realize they were committing
a tort”. [83]                         
Historically, it has been understood that the precise method
employed to make information available is immaterial: “There are no limitations
on the manner in which defamatory matter may be published” (Brown, at para.
7.3). In Day v. Bream (1837), 2 M. & Rob. 54, 174 E.R. 212, for
example, a person who merely delivered parcels was held prima facie
liable for putting them into publication; and in R. v. Clerk (1728), 1
Barn. K.B. 304, 94 E.R. 207, a case referred to by my colleague Abella J., a
printer’s servant whose sole role was to “clap down” the printing press was
found to be responsible for publication. However, the law has changed in the
centuries that have elapsed since Day v. Bream and R. v. Clerk. [84]                         
The courts have begun incrementally to impose limitations on the
nature and types of actions that can attract liability for defamation at common
law. To understand this evolution, it will be helpful to look broadly at cases
from both the United States and other common law jurisdictions, such as England
and Australia. I note that in considering the U.S. cases, we must be mindful of
the impact of the First Amendment on the protection of expression in the United
States, and of certain significant statutory limits on liability (see comments
to this effect: Godfrey v. Demon Internet Ltd., [1999] 4 All E.R. 342
(Q.B.), at pp. 343-44; Dow Jones & Co. v. Gutnick, [2002] HCA 56,
210 C.L.R. 575, at para. 52). [85]                         
There appears to be an emerging consensus among the courts and
commentators that only deliberate acts can meet the
first component of the bilateral conception of publication. According to
Prof. Brown, “a person must knowingly be involved in the process of
publishing the relevant words” (para. 7.4 (emphasis added)). In
Stanley v. Shaw, 2006 BCCA 467, 231 B.C.A.C. 186, pleading that the defendants “said and did nothing” (para. 7) was
held to be insufficient to support a finding of publication, because no
tortious act had been alleged in relation to their silence (see also Smith
v. Matsqui (Dist.) (1986), 4 B.C.L.R. (2d) 342 (S.C.), at p. 355; Wilson
v. Meyer, 126 P.3d 276 (Colo. Ct. App. 2005), at p. 281 (“[a] plaintiff
cannot establish [publication] by showing that the defendant silently adopted a
defamatory statement”); Pond v. General Electric Co., 256 F.2d 824 (9th
Cir. 1958), at p. 827 (“[s]ilence is not libel”); Brown, at
para. 7.3). In Scott v. Hull, 259 N.E.2d 160 (Ohio Ct. App. 1970), at p.
162, a U.S. court held that “liability to respond in damages for the publication
of a libel must be predicated on a positive act, on something done by the
person sought to be charged”. I agree with this view. [86]                         
A deliberate act may occur in a variety of circumstances. In
Byrne v. Deane, [1937] 1 K.B. 818 (C.A.), the defendants, proprietors of a
golf club, were found to have published the words contained on a piece of paper
that was posted on premises over which they held complete control. The
defendants admitted to having seen the paper, but denied having written it or
put it there. Although the words were ultimately found not to be defamatory,
Greene L.J., concurring on the issue of publication, concluded that there are
circumstances in which, by refraining from removing or obliterating defamatory
information, a person might in fact be publishing it (at p. 838):                     The test
it appears to me is this: having regard to all the facts of the case is the
proper inference that by not removing the defamatory matter the defendant
really made himself responsible for its continued presence in the place where
it had been put? (See also Hellar v. Bianco, 244
P.2d 757 (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 1952); Tacket v. General Motors Corp.,
836 F.2d 1042 (7th Cir. 1987); Urbanchich v. Drummoyne Municipal Council
(1991), Aust. Torts Rep. ¶81-127 (N.S.W.S.C.).) [87]                         
Byrne and its progeny are consistent with the requirement
that any finding of publication be grounded in a deliberate act. If a defendant
was made aware (or had reason to be aware) of defamatory information over which
he or she had sufficient control but decided to do nothing about it, this
nonfeasance might amount to a deliberate act of approval, adoption, promotion,
or ratification of the defamatory information (see, e.g., Frawley v. State
of New South Wales, [2007] NSWSC 1379 (AustLII)). The inference is not automatic,
but will depend on an assessment of the totality of the circumstances. In Underhill
v. Corser, [2010] EWHC 1195 (BAILII) (Q.B.), the defendant, who was
treasurer and a board member of a charity, had been aware that an editorial
levelling accusations against the plaintiff would be published, but took no
action and gave no further thought to the matter. Although Tugendhat J. found
that the defendant could have prevented the publication of the editorial, which
the plaintiff alleged to be defamatory, he distinguished Byrne,
concluding that the defendant’s role as a board member was different from that
of the proprietors in Byrne (para. 110). [88]                         
This requirement of a deliberate act has already been applied in
the context of the Internet. In Godfrey, the defendant Internet service
provider (“ISP”) had received a “posting”, which it stored on its news server.
The plaintiff had notified the ISP that the posting was defamatory and
requested that it be removed, but the defendant had allowed it to remain on its
servers until it automatically expired 10 days later. The court held that the
ISP’s failure to act, once it had become aware of the defamatory information
over which it had control, constituted an act of publication once an Internet
subscriber had accessed the posting. In the circumstances of the case, the
ISP’s failure to act amounted to a deliberate act of approval, adoption,
promotion or ratification of the defamatory information. [89]                         
In Bunt v. Tilley, [2006] EWHC 407, [2006] 3 All E.R. 336
(Q.B.), the defendant ISPs were found not to be publishers because, even though
they provided services, their role in the publication process was a passive
one. This aspect of the decision in Bunt is a
welcome development and should be incorporated into the Canadian common law.
Those whose services are used to facilitate the communication of defamatory
information may be shielded from responsibility for publication if they played
a “passive instrumental role” in that process (para. 23). [90]                         
A case that illustrates the nature of activities engaged in by a
person who plays the role of a mere conduit is Metropolitan International
Schools Ltd. v. Designtechnica Corpn., [2009] EWHC 1765, [2011] 1 W.L.R.
1743 (Q.B.). In that case, the question was whether Google Inc. could be found
to be the publisher of the search result “snippets” that were generated
automatically by its search engine in response to search terms entered by
users. Eady J. found that there was no publication, because Google Inc. played
a passive instrumental role in facilitating the appearance of the snippets on
the users’ screens (paras. 50-51). [91]                         
It should be plain that not every act
that makes the defamatory information available to a third party in a
comprehensible form might ultimately constitute publication. The plaintiff must
show that the act is deliberate. This requires showing that the defendant
played more than a passive instrumental role in making the information
available. [92]                         
The question that remains is whether, even with
these emerging limits on the common law principle, further refinements are
necessary. While I agree that improvements can be made, I do not share the view
of my colleague Abella J. that the solution is to exclude references, including
hyperlinks, from the scope of the publication rule.  In my view, the proper
approach is (1) to explicitly recognize the requirement of a deliberate act as
part of the Canadian common law publication rule, and (2) to continue
developing the rule incrementally in order to circumscribe the manner in which
a deliberate act must make defamatory information available if it is to result
in a finding of publication. [93]                         
More specifically, only where the plaintiff can
establish on a balance of probabilities that the defendant performed a
deliberate act that made defamatory information readily available to a
third party in a comprehensible form will the requirements of the first
component of publication be satisfied. Of course, before the court will make a
finding of publication, the plaintiff must also satisfy the requirements of the
second component of publication on a balance of probabilities, namely, that the
“defamatory matter [was] brought by the defendant or his agent to the
knowledge and understanding of some person other than the plaintiff” (McNichol,
at p. 704). [94]                         
Whether defamatory information is readily available is a question
of fact. A court asked to infer that information has been made readily
available should consider all circumstances related to the ease with which a
third party would be able to gain access to it. Defamatory information is
readily available if, in the circumstances, it can be immediately accessed. In
other words, there must be no meaningful barrier that would prevent a third
party from receiving it. In practice, this will not effect a significant change
to the common law, since, for the vast majority of acts that presently make
information available, there is nothing to prevent the information in question
from being received by third parties; they need only use their eyes to read or
view it, or their ears to hear it. Of course, if those third parties cannot understand
it, that is a separate concern, one that would on its own bar a finding of
publication. [95]                         
But the requirement that defamatory information be readily
available does result in an incremental change to the common law in those cases
where the act complained of refers third parties to defamatory information. It
narrows the circumstances in which the requirements of the first component of
publication will be satisfied. In such instances, the totality of circumstances
will reveal whether a third party can have immediate access — without any
meaningful barriers — to the information to which the reference directs him or
her. [96]                         
What should be clear from this is that not all forms of
references are the same as regards the extent to which they facilitate access
to the information in question. While my colleague’s statement that
“[h]yperlinks are, in essence, references” (para. 27) is superficially correct,
it is inaccurate to equate a hyperlink with, for example, a footnote in a book.
A footnote that does not actually reproduce the information to which the reader
is being referred does not make that information readily available. The reader
has to locate and obtain the document the footnote refers to and then find the
information within the document. In contrast, an automatic hyperlink requires
no action whatsoever, while an embedded deep hyperlink requires only the tap of
a finger to gain access to the information. The effort involved is even less
than that of turning a page in a book. Although it is of course true that
hyperlinks are a form of reference, the extent to which they facilitate access
and their ubiquity on the Internet cannot be overlooked. [97]                         
This Court has previously recognized the ease with which information
can be accessed by means of a hyperlink. In Dell, a hyperlink to an
arbitration clause was considered in relation to a provision of the Civil
Code of Québec, S.Q. 1991, c. 64, designed to deal with contractual
stipulations — known as external clauses — that are physically separate from
the contract itself. Adopting a contextual approach, the Court held that the
hyperlinked arbitration clause should not be considered physically separate
from the main contract document (at para. 97):                     .
. . it is difficult to accept that the need for a single command by the user
[i.e. clicking on a single hyperlink] would be sufficient for a finding that
the provision governing external clauses is applicable.  Such an
interpretation would be inconsistent with the reality of the Internet
environment, where no real distinction is made between scrolling through a
document and using a hyperlink.  Analogously to paper documents, some Web
documents contain several pages that can be accessed only by means of
hyperlinks, whereas others can be viewed by scrolling down them on the
computer’s screen.  There is no reason to favour one configuration over
the other. The arbitration clause in
Dell was found to be reasonably accessible, since clicking on one hyperlink
took the consumer directly to a page containing the terms and conditions of the
sale, including the arbitration clause. Thus, there was no material distinction
between having access to the clause by hyperlink and actually having a paper
copy of it (at para. 100):                     .
. . the clause was no more difficult for the consumer to access than would have
been the case had he or she been given a paper copy of the entire contract on
which the terms and conditions of sale appeared on the back of the first page. [98]                         
What can be inferred from the circumstances in Dell
is that the hyperlinked arbitration clause was, in fact, readily available: a
link to it appeared on every Web page the consumer accessed, and all the
consumer had to do to view the clause was to click on the link once (para.
100). [99]                         
Because the inquiry into availability is essentially factual, it
would be neither prudent nor desirable to attempt to adopt a bright-line rule
indicating the exact time when something becomes “readily” available. Such an
approach could hinder the evolution of the common law. However, given the
context of this appeal, a few specific observations about hyperlinks are in
order. In determining whether hyperlinked information was readily available, a
court should consider a number of factors, including whether the hyperlink was
user-activated or automatic, whether it was a shallow or a deep link, and
whether the linked information was available to the general public (as opposed
to being restricted). This list of factors is by no means exhaustive. Any
matter that has a bearing on the ease with which the referenced information
could be accessed will be relevant to the inquiry. [100]                     
The effect of this approach is not to create a
“presumption of liability for all hyperlinkers”, as Abella J. suggests (para.
25). In order to satisfy the requirements of the first component of
publication, the plaintiff must establish, on a balance of
probabilities, that the hyperlinker performed a deliberate act that made
defamatory information readily available to a third party in a comprehensible
form. Moreover, the plaintiff will also have to satisfy the requirements of the
second component of publication on a balance of probabilities, namely that a
third party received and understood the defamatory information. [101]                     
My colleague Abella J. states that “[r]eferencing on its own does
not involve exerting control over the content” (para. 26 (emphasis in
original)). Yet the concept of publication in the common law of defamation has
never involved a rigid requirement of control. Instead, the inquiry has always
been contextual: Did the defendant act knowingly and what were the consequences
of his actions? (See Brown, at para. 7.3.) Although a formal distinction can of
course be drawn between references and other acts of publication, this
distinction evades the questions that are at the heart of the law of
defamation. Where a person deliberately makes defamatory information readily
available through the creation of a hyperlink, the very rationale for the tort
of defamation comes into play. [102]                     
Because of the fluidity that characterizes the Internet and of
the variety in types of hyperlinks, the Court should be particularly reluctant
to fashion a bright-line rule. The approach it adopts must ensure that the law
is properly attuned to how hyperlinks function in practice and how they may
evolve in the future. Merely excluding hyperlinks from the scope of the
publication rule will hardly make it possible to adapt the law of defamation to
technological change. [103]                     
By exempting ISPs from liability for their passive conduct, U.S.
legislators have, in the Communications
Decency Act of 1996, 47
U.S.C. §230 (1996), relied on the same criterion of deliberateness that
exists in the common law of defamation. Nowhere does the American legislation
suggest that those who deliberately create hyperlinks to defamatory material
should be protected from liability. The cases cited by my colleague (at para.
28 of her reasons) all deal with the immunity enjoyed by ISPs and Web site operators
with respect to defamatory content posted on line (Zeran v. America Online, Inc., 129 F.3d 327 (4th Cir. 1997); Barrett
v. Rosenthal, 146 P.3d 510 (Cal. 2006); Fair Housing Council of San
Fernando Valley v. Roommates.Com, LLC, 521 F.3d 1157 (9th Cir. 2008)). [104]                     
In the English case of Islam Expo Ltd. v. The
Spectator (1828) Ltd., [2010] EWHC 2011 (BAILII)
(Q.B.), the issue was whether the words complained of were capable of
referring to the claimant. The allegedly defamatory information in that case
was an on-line text containing four hyperlinks. In concluding that the words
complained of were capable of referring to the claimant, the court regarded the
hyperlinked information as if it was incorporated into the message containing
the hyperlinks. At a conceptual level, I see no difference between looking at
the hyperlinked information to identify the defamed person and looking at it to
find the defamatory words. I agree with Tugendhat J.’s statement in Islam
Expo that the principles are the same. [105]                     
Finally, if hyperlinks are excluded from the traditional
conception of publication, there is a risk that freedom of expression will be
favoured over reputational interests despite this Court’s pronouncement that
they are “equally important” (Hill, at para. 121). Although I agree with
my colleague that the most effective remedy for someone who has been defamed on line is to sue the person who created
the defamatory material (para. 41), it may not always be possible to do so in
the context of the Internet. A hyperlink can make public what was originally
intended for only a select audience. Moreover, anonymity is easy to achieve on
line, and who created the defamatory material may not always be known. If no
remedy exists against “mere” hyperlinkers, persons defamed on line may in many
cases not be able to protect their reputations. [106]                     
In sum, an approach
that focuses on how a hyperlink makes defamatory information available offers a
more contextual and more nuanced response to developments in communications
media than merely excluding all hyperlinks from the scope of the publication
rule. [107]                     
Of course, proving that the hyperlinker deliberately made the
defamatory content readily available will satisfy only the requirements of the
first component of publication. To satisfy the requirements of the second
component, the plaintiff must demonstrate that a third party received and
understood the defamatory information (McNichol, at p. 704; Brown, at
paras. 7.2 and 7.8; Gatley on Libel and Slander, at p. 164). [108]                     
I agree with the Court of Appeal in the instant
case that a legal presumption should not be created in this regard. The
legislatures of certain provinces, including British Columbia, have created
presumptions of publication that apply to particular communications media.
Under the Libel and Slander Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 263, there is a
presumption of publication in respect of “broadcast[s]” but not in respect of
hyperlinks (s. 2). Since the legislature has seen fit to create a specific
presumption of publication, the Court should refrain from creating a new one. [109]                     
Absent a presumption of publication, the
requirements of the second component of publication can be satisfied either by
adducing direct evidence or, and this is more likely, by asking the court to
draw an inference. Inferring that defamatory information has been read and
understood is not new. In Gaskin, the Court, quoting Gatley on Libel and Slander, observed
(at p. 300):                                      It
is not necessary for the plaintiff in every case to prove directly that the
words complained of were brought to the actual knowledge of some third person.
If he proves facts from which it can reasonably be inferred that the words were
brought to the knowledge of some third person, he will establish a prima facie
case. [110]                     
In the context of a hyperlink, an inference that a third party
clicked on the link and read and understood the linked information will depend
on a variety of factors, some of which may overlap with those considered when
determining whether the linked content was made “readily available”. Some, but
not necessarily all, of the factors a court can consider are: whether the link
was user-activated or automatic; whether it was a deep or a shallow link;
whether the page contained more than one hyperlink and, if so, where the
impugned link was located in relation to others; the context in which the link
was presented to users; the number of hits on the page containing the
hyperlink; the number of hits on the page containing the linked information
(both before and after the page containing the link was posted); whether access
to the Web sites in question was general or restricted; whether changes were
made to the linked information and, if so, how they correlate with the number
of hits on the page containing that information; and evidence concerning the
behaviour of Internet users. [111]                     
Abella J. indicates that merely
referring to defamatory material does not constitute publication of it (para.
42). Insofar as this means that a simple reference should not attract liability
for defamation absent evidence that satisfies the requirements of both
components of publication on a balance of probabilities, I agree. But if it
means that a simple reference cannot form the basis for a finding of
publication without actually expressing something defamatory, I cannot agree. [112]                     
As the Court held in Grant,
at para. 28, a plaintiff in an action for defamation is required to prove three
things to succeed: (1) that the impugned words were defamatory, (2) that the
words referred to the plaintiff and (3) that they were published. Once the
plaintiff establishes prima facie liability for defamation, the onus
shifts to the defendant to raise any available defences. There are some
defences that are worth discussing briefly in the context of hyperlinking. [113]                     
The Court has in the past alluded
to the existence of an “innocent dissemination” defence: SOCAN. In that
case, this defence was described as follows (at para. 89):                     .
. . the defence of innocent dissemination [is] sometimes available to
bookstores, libraries, news vendors, and the like who, generally speaking, have
no actual knowledge of an alleged libel, are aware of no circumstances to put
them on notice to suspect a libel, and committed no negligence in failing to
find out about the libel . . . . [114]                     
In my view, the innocent
dissemination defence should be made available to hyperlinkers, provided that
the criteria mentioned in SOCAN are satisfied. There are good reasons
for so holding. Hyperlinkers have not created or developed the information to
which they link. Moreover, although the creation of a hyperlink may often be a
deliberate act that makes the creator’s role more than a passive one, the
hyperlinker often has little control, if any, over the linked information. This
last point is significant given the dynamic nature of the Internet. A hyperlink
may originally be created to link to information that is not defamatory, but
the linked information may subsequently be altered so as to become defamatory
without the hyperlinker’s knowledge. In such circumstances, provided that the
criteria mentioned in SOCAN are satisfied, the innocent dissemination
defence should operate until the moment the hyperlinker becomes aware that he
or she is now linking to allegedly defamatory information. If this defence were
widely available, it should dissuade overeager litigants from having a chilling
effect on hyperlinking on the Internet. [115]                     
Even when the innocent
dissemination defence is not available to hyperlinkers, other defences may
apply, such as those of fair comment (WIC) and of responsible
communication on matters of public interest (Grant). In Grant,
the Court, quoting Jameel v. Wall Street Journal Europe SPRL, [2006]
UKHL 44, [2007] 1 A.C. 359, at para. 54, made the latter defence “available to anyone who publishes material of public interest in any medium”
(para. 96). Moreover, it defined the concept of “public interest” expansively
(at para. 106):                             Public
interest is not confined to publications on government and political matters,
as it is in Australia and New Zealand.  Nor is it necessary that the plaintiff
be a “public figure”, as in the American jurisprudence since Sullivan [New
York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964)].  Both qualifications cast
the public interest too narrowly. The public has a genuine stake in knowing
about many matters, ranging from science and the arts to the environment,
religion and morality. The democratic interest in such wide-ranging public
debate must be reflected in the jurisprudence. [116]                     
These defences, when available, would enable the
hyperlinker to justify his or her conduct and avoid liability. [117]                     
It should be evident that the law of defamation,
viewed as a whole, is the result of a sustained effort to maintain a balance
between the protection of reputation and freedom of expression. An approach
that limits the discussion to the fact that what is in issue is a reference and
disregards the context, including the nature of the reference and the various
aspects of the law of defamation, is too narrow. In my view, the question of
publication must be approached from a wider perspective, bearing in mind the
incremental adjustments made to the law of defamation in recent years (e.g., WIC
and Grant). Moreover, any further adjustments to defamation law
should also be made incrementally, not by way of a sweeping declaration that
treats all forms of reference alike and rules out the possibility of a
reference to defamatory material supporting a finding of publication. V.     Application [118]                     
Mr. Newton admits that he created the two hyperlinks
which refer readers to the allegedly defamatory information. [119]                     
Mr. Newton’s involvement in creating the
hyperlinks cannot be described as a passive instrumental role equivalent to
that of a mere conduit, such as an ISP or a telephone carrier. His acts were
deliberate. Moreover, it is common ground that the allegedly defamatory
information to which Mr. Newton linked was available to Internet users in a
comprehensible form, and without restrictions. The question is whether the
information was readily available. [120]                     
The first link, “OpenPolitics.ca”, was a
shallow link to the Open Politics Web site. The evidence indicates that to
consult the allegedly defamatory articles on that Web site,  Internet users who
initially clicked on the shallow link would then have had to take further
action (i.e. click on other links) to locate them. [121]                     
The second link, “Wayne Crookes”,
was a deep link to an article on www.USGovernetics.com that Mr. Crookes also
alleges to be defamatory. Clicking on the link would take a user directly to
the allegedly defamatory information. [122]                     
Both of these hyperlinks appeared in an article entitled “Free
Speech in Canada”, which contained five other hyperlinks. The article dealt
with free speech and defamation law, and referred to lawsuits concerning these
issues. There were 1,788 hits on it between July 18, 2006, when it was created,
and February 1, 2008. [123]                     
There is nothing in the record that indicates whether anyone
other than Mr. Crookes clicked on any of the links. Nor is there any
information, from any point in time, on the number of hits on the Web pages
containing the allegedly defamatory statements. And no evidence has been
presented regarding the behaviour of Internet users. [124]                     
Having regard to the totality of the circumstances, I am not
prepared to infer in this case that the link to the Open Politics Web site made
the defamatory content readily available. Because this was a shallow link, the
reader would have to take further action in order to find the defamatory
material. Exactly what action would have been necessary is unclear, but the
evidence indicates that the various articles were not placed on the site’s home
page and that they had separate addresses. This constituted a meaningful
barrier to the receipt, by a third party, of the linked information. Insofar as
Mr. Crookes’ defamation action against Mr. Newton is premised on this
hyperlink, it cannot succeed. [125]                     
However, I am prepared to infer that the “Wayne Crookes”
link to the allegedly defamatory article on www.USGovernetics.com did make the
content of that article readily available.  It was a deep link. All the reader
had to do to gain access to the article was to click on the link. The effort
required to do this is not significantly different from the effort that would
be required to move up or down the same page to read the article. A single
click does not constitute a barrier to the availability of the material. Thus,
Mr. Crookes has satisfied the requirements of the first component of
publication on a balance of probabilities where this link is concerned. [126]                     
On the second component of publication, I agree with the Court of
Appeal, which was unanimous on this point, that the courts should not create a
presumption of publication with respect to hyperlinks. As I mentioned above,
and as Prowse J.A. explained (at para. 41), the creation of a new presumption
in this field is a matter that would be better left to the legislature. [127]                     
The determinative question is therefore whether Mr. Crookes has
proven facts from which it can reasonably be inferred that the allegedly
defamatory information was brought to the knowledge of some third person. On
this point, I agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal that the evidence
in this case does not support such an inference. I come to this conclusion
mindful of the Internet context, the nature of Mr. Newton’s article, the way
the various links were presented, the facts that the “Wayne Crookes”
link was the third of seven links contained in Mr. Newton’s article and that at
least one shallow link appeared before it, and the number of hits on the
article between July 18, 2006, and February 1, 2008. Numbers take on a different
meaning in the context of the Internet. The number of hits on Mr. Newton’s
article — 1,788 — in the 18-month period does not provide a sufficient basis
for concluding that out of the seven hyperlinks, someone has both clicked on
the only link that made the defamatory information readily available and read
that information. [128]                     
 In Internet law, as it presently stands, a bare number of hits
will tell the trier of fact very little. As the majority of the Court of Appeal
noted (at para. 92):                     In
the context of internet life, we have no way to assess the volume of “hits”
here compared to the norm, the usual behaviour of internet readers or
“surfers”, or the jurisdiction in which they reside. The conclusion drawn by my
colleague is, with respect, tantamount to a presumption that in the case of a
website accessed to any significant extent, there has been communication of the
offensive material. . . . There may be cases in which
more is known supporting such an inference, but such is not the case here where
all that is before us is the bald number of hits. In my view there is an
insufficient basis upon which to make such an inference . . . . [129]                     
Because Mr. Crookes has not established facts supporting the
second component of publication, he cannot succeed in his defamation action
with respect to either of the impugned hyperlinks. [130]                     
As a final comment, I would point out that, even if Mr. Newton
had been found prima facie to be liable for defamation, he could likely,
having regard to the record before the Court, have raised one of the existing
defences, given that his article concerned matters that were arguably of public
interest. I conclude that the hyperlinks at issue in this case did not result
in publication of the information to which they referred the reader, and I
would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.                     Appeal
