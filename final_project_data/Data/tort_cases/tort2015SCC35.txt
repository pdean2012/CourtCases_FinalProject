1964, H was unjustly sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment for armed robbery. He
was granted parole after serving a third of his sentence. In 1966, he had
persuaded three of the five perpetrators of the robbery to sign affidavits to
clear his name. Between 1967 and 1981, H submitted three applications for mercy
to the federal Minister of Justice (“Minister”) under the Criminal Code 
and an application for a pardon to the Governor General in Council. They were
all denied. In 1988, he applied to the Commission de police du Québec, which,
following an investigation, said that it hoped the Attorney General of Quebec
(“AGQ”) would intervene with the Solicitor General of Canada so that justice
would be done. In 1990, H submitted a fourth application for mercy, but the
Minister replied that he should seek relief in the Quebec Court of Appeal,
which he did. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, but instead of entering
an acquittal or ordering a new trial, it directed a stay of proceedings. On
January 21, 1997, the Supreme Court of Canada unanimously acquitted H in a
judgment delivered from the bench, as it was of the view that the evidence
could not allow a reasonable and properly instructed jury to find H guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt. H then instituted an action in civil liability for
an order for solidary payment against the AGQ, the Attorney General of Canada
(“AGC”) and the town of Mont-Laurier. Under out-of-court settlements, the town
and the AGQ paid him a total of $5,550,000 in compensation. After these
settlements, H continued to claim $1,079,871 for his pecuniary losses and
$1,900,000 for his non-pecuniary losses, as well as $10,000,000 in punitive
damages, from the AGC.                     The
Superior Court allowed the action and ordered the AGC to pay H a total of
almost $5.8 million. It found, pursuant to the Crown Liability and
Proceedings Act , that the Minister was subject to Quebec’s rules of civil
liability, that he was not protected by any immunity, that he had committed a
fault of “institutional inertia” or “institutional indifference”, and that a
sustained, concerted and extensive review would have uncovered the errors. It
ordered the AGC to pay H more than $850,000 for pecuniary damage and $1,900,000
for non-pecuniary damage, as well as $2,500,000 in punitive damages. It also
found that the AGC’s conduct at trial had amounted to an abuse of process and
ordered him to pay $100,000 for fees H had paid to the first law firm that had
represented him, as well as $440,000 for the value of the services rendered by
the second even though that firm had never billed him for fees, as they had
entered into a pro bono agreement.                     The
Court of Appeal reversed the judgment. It found that the exercise of the
Minister’s power of mercy is protected by a qualified immunity and that the
Crown can be held liable only if the decision was made in bad faith, and with
malice. In this case, the court found that it had not been proven that the
Minister had committed a fault and that, even if it were assumed that a fault
had been committed, there was nothing to suggest that the miscarriage of
justice would have been ascertained quickly if the Minister had acted promptly.                     Held:
The appeal should be dismissed.                     The
power of mercy codified in the Criminal Code  derives from the royal
prerogative of mercy. At the material time, the applicable provisions of the Criminal
Code  left it up to the Minister to determine in what circumstances he or
she should intervene. In making this discretionary decision, the Minister had
to assess and weigh public policy considerations on the basis of social,
political and economic factors. This power came into play after all judicial
remedies had been exhausted, and the Minister, in exercising it, had to be
careful to avoid usurping the role of the courts and short-circuiting the usual
judicial process. The history and the nature of the power of mercy show that
the exercise of that power was a true core policy act. The exercise of such a
power could not therefore expose the Crown to liability unless the Minister
acted irrationally or in bad faith.                     To
assess the Minister’s conduct in the exercise of his power of mercy, it would
be inappropriate to apply a standard of fault that limits bad faith to malice.
In Quebec civil law, bad faith is broader than just intentional fault or a
demonstrated intent to harm another. Bad faith can be established by proving
that the Minister acted deliberately with the specific intent to harm another
person, or by proof of serious recklessness that reveals a breakdown of the
orderly exercise of authority so fundamental that absence of good faith can be
deduced and bad faith presumed. In light of the applicable provisions of the Criminal
Code  and of the fact that there was, at the relevant time, no established
procedure to guide the exercise of the power of mercy, the Minister was required
to conduct a meaningful review of any application that was neither frivolous
nor vexatious. However, this review was not equivalent to the one that would be
expected from a police investigation or a commission of inquiry. The duty to
conduct a meaningful review entails a duty to make a decision in good faith on
the basis of the evidence uncovered by that review.                     The
trial judge erred in approaching the issue of the federal Crown’s civil
liability from the perspective of a fault of institutional inertia or
indifference. The analysis should instead have focused on the individual
conduct of each Minister acting in his or her capacity as a servant of the
federal Crown. The trial judge also erred in considering the powers of a
commissioner under the Inquiries Act  as a basis for determining whether
the review conducted by the Minister was a meaningful one, given that those
powers were not conferred on the Minister until 2002, when Parliament reformed
the procedure in respect of applications for mercy. Moreover, there is no
legislation establishing an obligation for the federal government or the
provinces to compensate victims of miscarriages of justice, nor is there any
legislation establishing a right to such compensation. Nor did the Guidelines:
Compensation for Wrongfully Convicted and Imprisoned Persons require the
federal government to compensate H, as they do not constitute binding
legislation.                     In
this case, H has failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the
Minister acted in bad faith or with serious recklessness in reviewing his
applications for mercy. The documentary evidence negates the trial judge’s
inference that there was no review whatsoever of H’s initial application for
mercy. Although there are only a few documents in the record, they attest to
the fact that a certain review was conducted and that certain actions were
taken in this regard. By way of admissions, the parties acknowledged that
certain government employees would have confirmed that, as they had understood
the facts, an extensive and careful review of the case was under way at the
time in question. A delay in reviewing the initial application was raised, but
despite this, an analysis of the circumstances does not support the conclusion
that the Minister acted in bad faith or with serious recklessness. As for H’s
three subsequent applications, it cannot reasonably be argued that no
meaningful review was conducted in respect of them. The relevant correspondence
shows the opposite to be true. Regarding the second application, which was very
brief and contained no new evidence or legal arguments, it was open to the
Minister to find it frivolous and to reject it on that basis. As for the third
application, given that it did not go into much detail, the allegations based
on vague irregularities could have struck the Minister as being of little
consequence. In the case of the fourth application, it was reasonable for the
Minister to justify her decision by noting that the Court of Appeal could
consider the case on its own without her having to intervene, particularly
given that the Minister did not reject the application outright.                     Some
additional comments on causation and damages are in order. Even if it were
assumed that the Minister failed to conduct a meaningful review of the first
application, the evidence does not establish that he would probably have
discovered at that time the key evidence uncovered by the investigator of the
Commission de police 20 years later. To conclude otherwise would be to rely on
mere conjecture or remote hypotheticals. H has failed to establish a causal
connection between the Minister’s fault and the alleged damage.                     On
the issue of damages, the trial judge failed to take into account the
requirement that the liability be apportioned solidarily, and to establish the
amounts being awarded on the basis of the actual liability of each of the
solidary debtors. To the extent that more than one solidary debtor could be
liable for heads of claim, the releases granted by H to the AGQ and the town of
Mont-Laurier made it necessary to examine the causal faults and apportion
liability. H should have borne the shares of the solidary debtors he had
released (arts. 1526 and 1690 C.C.Q.). In addition to this overriding
error, the grounds for each of the heads of damages were also flawed. Where the
question of pecuniary damage is concerned, there is no direct connection
between the Minister’s conduct and H’s decision to retire at age 60, the fees
and costs incurred in respect of the proceedings brought in the Court of Appeal
and the Supreme Court between 1990 and 1997 did not result from the alleged
faults, and wasted time and efforts expended to obtain justice are
inconveniences that are inherent in the efforts of anyone who is involved in
legal proceedings. As for non-pecuniary damage, an order that the AGC pay
$1,900,000 after the AGQ had paid $1,100,000 under the same head of damages
would seem to be disproportionate, and the amounts granted in other cases of
miscarriages of justice were mostly made further to the recommendations of
advisory bodies and were based on considerations that are different from those
on which damages are based in principle. Moreover, those cases were different
in that they involved the much more serious crime of murder and in that the
period of incarceration was longer in almost all of them. On the issue of
punitive damages, even though the reference in the Crown Liability and
Proceedings Act  to the Quebec rules of extracontractual civil liability
encompasses the remedy of punitive damages provided for in the Charter of
human rights and freedoms, it was not appropriate to award such damages in
this case. Given that the Minister’s conduct cannot be equated with bad faith
or serious recklessness, it cannot be concluded that there was intentional interference
with a right protected by the Charter. The evidence does not support a
finding that the Minister’s state of mind was such that he intended to harm H
or had knowledge of the adverse consequences his conduct would have for H.                     In
Quebec law, it is only in exceptional cases that a party can be required to pay
the fees of lawyers retained by the opposing party, and such compensation must
be consistent with the general rules of civil liability. Only an abuse of
process can justify awarding extrajudicial fees as damages. However, by virtue
of art. 1608 C.C.Q., the obligation to pay damages to the other party is
neither reduced nor altered by the fact that the latter received a gratuitous
benefit from his or her counsel. In this case, the AGC’s conduct did not amount
to an abuse of process. The law on the federal Crown’s liability for a fault
committed by the Minister in exercising his or her power of mercy was far from
clear at the time of the dispute, and it was reasonable and appropriate for the
AGC to contest H’s action and raise the defence that he did. The trial judge
committed a palpable and overriding error in finding that there had been an
abuse of process in the context of this case. H was not entitled to the
extrajudicial fees that were awarded. Cases Cited                     Applied:

Introduction [1]                             
Although it receives praise from around the
world, the Canadian criminal justice system is not free from the risk of
miscarriages of justice. Where such situations arise — although fortunately
very rare, they have serious consequences — certain remedies are available to
the victims. One such remedy is the discretionary power of mercy provided for
in the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46  (“Cr. C.”), which
enables the federal Minister of Justice (“Minister” or “Ministers”) to help
rectify miscarriages of justice in certain cases. In this appeal, the Court is
being asked for the first time to rule on the standard of conduct that applies
to the exercise of this power and on the circumstances in which the federal
Crown might be exposed to liability. [2]                             
The appellant, Réjean Hinse, was wrongly
convicted of armed robbery. Under out-of-court settlements, the town of Mont-Laurier
(“Mont-Laurier”) and the Attorney General of Quebec (“AGQ”) paid him a total of
$5,550,000 in compensation for this miscarriage of justice. According to Mr. Hinse,
this compensation was incomplete, however, since the Ministers who had decided
on his applications for mercy over the years had also committed a fault against
him by failing to diligently exercise their power in his favour. [3]                             
The Quebec Superior Court found that a simple
fault was sufficient for the Crown to be liable in respect of the Minister’s
conduct. The trial judge concluded that a fault of [translation] “institutional inertia” or “institutional
indifference” on the federal government’s part had caused Mr. Hinse damage
equivalent to nearly $5.8 million. The Court of Appeal reversed that judgment,
expressing the opinion that the person who exercises this power of mercy is
protected by an immunity analogous to the one that applies to a Crown
prosecutor in a case of malicious prosecution. Given that there was no
intentional or gross fault, or even a simple fault, on the Minister’s part, it
dismissed Mr. Hinse’s action against the Attorney General of Canada (“AGC”). [4]                             
We are of the opinion that, at the material
time, the exercise of the Minister’s power of mercy was a true policy decision.
The Minister was therefore protected by a qualified (or “relative”) immunity.
On being presented with an application for mercy that was neither frivolous nor
vexatious, the Minister had a duty to conduct a meaningful review of the
application, and a breach of that duty amounting to bad faith, which
encompasses serious recklessness, could expose the Crown to liability. [5]                             
We agree with the Court of Appeal that, on a
balance of probabilities, the evidence does not support the trial judge’s
inference that the Ministers violated the rules of civil liability in this
case. We also agree with the judges of that court that, in any event, Mr. Hinse
failed to discharge his burden of proving the requisite causal connection
between the Ministers’ actions and the alleged damage. Finally, we agree with
the Court of Appeal that the damages awarded to the appellant in excess of the
$5,550,000 he had already received were inappropriate. The appeal should
therefore be dismissed. II.       Background and Judicial History [6]                             
In September 1964, Mr. Hinse was found guilty of
an armed robbery that he claimed not to have committed. He was sentenced to 15 years’
imprisonment. Because a request he made for legal aid was denied, he did not
appeal his conviction. However, he began to take steps to have his conviction
recognized as a miscarriage of justice. [7]                             
In 1966, he persuaded three of the five
perpetrators of the robbery to sign affidavits to clear his name. On April 24,
1967, he wrote to the Minister, seeking recognition of the miscarriage of
justice of which he claimed to be a victim. This was the beginning of a
correspondence that would span more than three decades. Although he was in
prison at the time of the initial exchanges, Mr. Hinse was granted parole in
1969 after serving a third of his sentence. [8]                             
Mr. Hinse submitted three applications for mercy
between 1967 and 1981. He also applied to the Governor General in Council for a
pardon in 1971. All these applications were denied. In 1988, he applied to the
Commission de police du Québec (“Commission de police”). Following an
investigation into Mr. Hinse’s allegations, the Commission de police found that
his complaint was [translation] “sufficiently
troubling” and the facts gathered were “sufficiently probative” to warrant
submitting a report, which it forwarded to the AGQ and the Quebec Minister of
Public Security: A.R., vol. XI, at p. 36. In its report, the Commission de
police said that it hoped the AGQ would intervene with the Solicitor General of
Canada so that “justice will be done” to Mr. Hinse: ibid., at p. 68. The
Quebec Minister of Public Security sent the report to the Solicitor General of
Canada on November 20, 1990. It was at this point that Mr. Hinse submitted a
fourth application for mercy. The Minister replied that he should seek relief
in the Quebec Court of Appeal, which he did. [9]                             
On June 8, 1994, after granting Mr. Hinse leave
to file a notice of appeal and introduce fresh evidence, the Court of Appeal
allowed his appeal: (1994), 64 Q.A.C. 53.
But instead of entering an acquittal or ordering a new trial, the court
exercised its inherent jurisdiction and directed a stay of proceedings for
abuse of process, although that was not the result Mr. Hinse had requested. [10]                         
Mr. Hinse then
appealed the case to this Court, challenging the legality and the
constitutionality of the stay of proceedings. The Court denied him leave to
appeal to it: [1995] 1 S.C.R. viii. Mr. Hinse refused to give up, filing an
application for reconsideration. On November 30, 1995, the Court allowed his
application and granted him leave to appeal: [1995] 4 S.C.R. 597. On January 21,
1997, it unanimously acquitted him in a judgment delivered from the bench,
“being of the view that the evidence could not allow a reasonable jury properly
instructed to find the appellant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt”: [1997] 1
S.C.R. 3, at para. 2. [11]                         
On February 4, 1997, Mr. Hinse sent the AGC a formal notice. On June 5, 1997, he
instituted an action for an order for solidary payment against three
defendants: the AGQ, the AGC and Mont-Laurier. On November 15, 2002, Mont-Laurier
signed a transaction with him for a total of $250,000. On December 2, 2010, the
AGQ, too, entered into a transaction, this one for a total of $5,300,000 in
principal, interest and costs. This out-of-court settlement came more than four
weeks into the hearing on the merits of the action, after the parties had
presented their evidence but before they had made their oral arguments. [12]                         
The hearing on the merits thus ended with the
AGC as the sole defendant. In respect of the AGC, Mr. Hinse alleged that the
federal government had helped to perpetuate and exacerbate the damage he had
suffered by failing to act diligently to acknowledge and rectify the
miscarriage of justice of which he had been the victim. He submitted that the
conduct of the federal government [translation]
“was indicative of reprehensible carelessness, recklessness and total
denial, which must be denounced and condemned [by the award of] exemplary
damages”: A.R., vol. IV, at p. 31. After the settlement with the AGQ was reached,
he continued to claim $1,079,871 for his pecuniary losses and $1,900,000 for
his non-pecuniary losses, as well as $10,000,000 in punitive damages, from the
AGC. A.      
Quebec Superior Court, 2011 QCCS 1780, [2011] R.J.Q. 794 [13]                         
The Superior Court allowed Mr. Hinse’s action
and ordered the AGC to pay him a total of almost $5.8 million. [14]                         
Poulin J. began by determining that the out-of-court
settlements Mr. Hinse had reached with Mont-Laurier and with the AGQ
constituted an express release from the debt. Mr.
Hinse therefore did not have to prove any fault on their parts. However,
the federal Crown could be held liable only for the share of the damage caused
by its servants: paras. 17-22; art. 1690 of the Civil Code of Québec (“C.C.Q.”). [15]                         
Poulin J. then found that the Minister was
subject to Quebec’s rules of civil liability and was not protected by any
immunity: paras. 62-63. She concluded that he had committed a fault of [translation] “institutional inertia” or
“institutional indifference”: paras. 33, 55 and 75-76. The Minister had had a
duty to conduct a meaningful review of Mr. Hinse’s applications, but had failed
to do so: paras. 71 and 73. [16]                         
Poulin J. was of the opinion that Mr. Hinse had
proved causation by means of presumptions of fact, given that [translation] “[a] sustained, concerted,
extensive, competent and timely review of his initial efforts would surely have
brought the errors to the AGC’s attention”: paras. 75 and 98. In her view, Mr. Hinse
had proved the damage he had suffered. She ordered the AGC to pay him more than
$850,000 for pecuniary damage and $1,900,000 for non-pecuniary damage. She also
found that the AGC was guilty of unlawful and intentional interference with Mr.
Hinse’s right to dignity and awarded Mr. Hinse $2,500,000 in exemplary damages.
Finally, she found that the AGC’s conduct at trial had amounted to an abuse of
process. She ordered him to pay Mr. Hinse $100,000 for fees he had paid to the
first law firm that had represented him, as well as $440,000 for the value of
the services rendered by the second even though it had never billed him for
fees, as they had entered into a pro bono agreement. B.       Quebec Court of Appeal, 2013 QCCA 1513 [17]                         
The Court of Appeal reversed Poulin J.’s judgment.
It expressed disagreement with her finding on the issue of immunity. In its
view, the exercise of the Minister’s power of mercy is protected by a qualified
immunity: para. 141. As a result, the Crown can be held liable only if the
Minister’s decision was made in bad faith, and with malice: paras. 144 and 150. [18]                         
The Court of Appeal found that it had not been
proven that the Minister had committed a fault: para. 157. The court
acknowledged that it was difficult [translation]
“to accurately gauge what kind of study was conducted, because of the
summary nature of the evidence adduced”, but inferred nothing negative from the
brevity of the Minister’s decision: para. 170 (CanLII). At the time in
question, the Minister was under no obligation to give reasons for his or her
decisions, and good faith on his or her part had to be presumed. The Court of
Appeal also rejected the view that the time it had taken the Minister to reach
a decision had caused the damage: even if it were assumed that a fault had been
committed, there was nothing to suggest that the miscarriage of justice would
have been ascertained quickly if the Minister had acted promptly (paras. 171-72). [19]                         
The Court of Appeal went on to say that even if
it were assumed that there had been some fault on the AGC’s part, Poulin J. had
failed to apportion liability among the AGC, the AGQ and Mont-Laurier for the
purpose of calculating the damages: paras. 193 et seq. On the issue of punitive
damages, the court found that even if a fault had been proven, there had been
no unlawful and intentional interference with Mr. Hinse’s fundamental rights:
paras. 228-32. Finally, it rejected
Poulin J.’s findings with respect to abuse of process: para. 242. III.    Issues [20]                         
The appeal raises several issues, which can be
summarized as follows: 1.        
What rules of civil liability apply to the
Minister’s power of mercy? 2.        
Has the appellant shown that the Minister’s
conduct constituted a fault in this case? 3.        
If so, has the appellant proven a causal
connection between the Minister’s fault and the alleged damage? 4.        
If so, is the appellant entitled to compensatory
or punitive damages and to compensation for his counsel’s extrajudicial fees? IV.    Analysis A.       Rules of Civil Liability That Apply to the Minister’s Power of Mercy (1)       Extracontractual Liability of the Crown [21]                         
The original legislation respecting civil
liability of the federal Crown was the Crown Liability Act, S.C. 1952-53,
c. 30, which later became the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act,
R.S.C. 1985, c. C-50  (“C.L.P.A. ”). The C.L.P.A. provides that
whether the federal Crown is liable for damages is governed by the law of the
jurisdiction where the acts in question were committed. In Quebec, the combined
effect of the C.L.P.A.  and the C.C.Q. is that the federal Crown
is generally subject to the rules of civil liability set out in art. 1457 C.C.Q.:
Canadian Food Inspection Agency v. Professional Institute of the Public Service
of Canada, 2010 SCC 66, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 657, at paras. 25-26. In the
instant case, the Crown is alleged to be liable in respect of the fault of its
servants: ss. 2  “liability” and 3(a)(i) C.L.P.A. [22]                         
However, art. 1376 C.C.Q. provides that
the rules respecting liability set out in the C.C.Q. apply “to the State
and its bodies, and to all other legal persons established in the public
interest, subject to any other rules of law which may be applicable to them”.
This Court has found, for example, that general principles or rules of public
law may either prevent the general rules of civil liability from applying or
substantially alter how they are applied: Finney v. Barreau du Québec,
2004 SCC 36, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 17, at para. 27; Prud’homme v. Prud’homme,
2002 SCC 85, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 663, at para. 31; Canadian Food Inspection
Agency, at para. 26. [23]                         
The principles in question include those
relating to Crown immunity, which the Court considered in R. v. Imperial
Tobacco Canada Ltd., 2011 SCC 42, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 45; see also Canadian
Food Inspection Agency, at para. 27; s. 8 C.L.P.A. In Imperial
Tobacco, the Court noted that the prevailing view in Canada is that only
“true” policy decisions are protected by Crown immunity. The Court explained
that it is not helpful to posit a stark dichotomy between policy decisions and
operational decisions, or to define policy decisions negatively as decisions
that are not “operational” decisions: paras. 84-86. Although it refrained from
establishing a black-and-white test, the Court concluded that core policy
government decisions that are protected from suit are “decisions as to a course
or principle of action that are based on public policy considerations, such as
economic, social and political factors, provided they are neither irrational
nor taken in bad faith”: para. 90. Policy decisions form a narrow subset of
discretionary decisions. Such a decision is a considered decision that
represents “a ‘policy’ in the sense of a general rule or approach, applied to a
particular situation”: para. 87. To determine whether a decision is a policy
decision, the role of the person who makes it may be of assistance, given that
employees working at the operational level are not usually involved in making
policy choices: paras. 87-90. [24]                         
In Imperial Tobacco, the Court did
not lay down a strict rule that only “true” core policy decisions can be
protected by a qualified immunity. On the contrary, it stated that “[a] black
and white test that will provide a ready and irrefutable answer for every
decision in the infinite variety of decisions that government actors may
produce is likely chimerical”: para. 90. Although that case concerned the
federal Crown’s liability for negligence at common law, its conclusions on the
issue of immunity for acts of the Crown pertained to public law, which means
that they are applicable to Quebec’s rules relating to Crown liability. [25]                         
With these principles in mind, we must begin by
characterizing the nature of the ministerial power at issue so as to determine
whether it is a true core policy act to which a qualified immunity applies.
Having done this, we must identify the standard of fault that applies to this
power and then, after defining the nature of the duties owed by the Minister
during the material period, apply this standard to the facts. (2)       Nature of the Ministerial Power at Issue [26]                         
In the case at bar, Poulin J. found that the
Minister is subject to the rules of civil liability and is not protected by any
immunity when he or she exercises the power of mercy. But the Court of Appeal
held that the Minister is in fact protected by a qualified immunity, given that
the power in question stems from a royal prerogative and is exercised in a
policy rather than an operational capacity. In this Court, the appellant
submits that the Minister acts in the context of a statutory process, not of a
royal prerogative, and that the standard is the existence of a simple fault. He
argues that there is a distinction between the processing of applications for
mercy and the Minister’s final decision. In his view, the processing of
applications falls within the operational sphere and should not be protected by
any immunity. As for the
respondent, he supports the Court of Appeal’s analysis and its conclusion. [27]                         
Applications for mercy are governed by the Cr.
C. Four successive provisions applied during the material period. They are
reproduced in the Appendix. It can be seen from these provisions that the
discretionary nature of the Minister’s power (“[t]he Minister of Justice may”)
and the requirement that the Minister conduct an inquiry (“if after inquiry he
is satisfied that in the circumstances”) were constants throughout this period. [28]                         
We agree with the Court of Appeal that the power
of mercy codified in the Cr. C. derives from the royal prerogative of
mercy. Most academic commentators are also in agreement with this. Historically,
the royal prerogative of mercy has had two strands and two objectives: to show
compassion by relieving an individual of the full weight of his or her
sentence, and to correct miscarriages of justice such as wrongful convictions
(G. T. Trotter, “Justice, Politics and the Royal Prerogative of Mercy:
Examining the Self-Defence Review” (2001), 26 Queen’s L.J. 339, at p. 344,
citing A. T. H. Smith, “The Prerogative of Mercy, the Power of Pardon and
Criminal Justice”, [1983] P.L. 398). The prerogative was incorporated
into Canadian law and conferred on the Governor General by letters patent: Attorney
General for Canada v. Attorney General of the Province of Ontario (1894),
23 S.C.R. 458, at pp. 468-69; Letters Patent Constituting the Office of
Governor General of Canada (1947), Canada Gazette, Part I, vol. 81,
p. 3014 (reproduced in R.S.C. 1985, App. II, No. 31). [29]                         
Until 2002, the second strand of the royal
prerogative of mercy, that of the rectification of miscarriages of justice, was
codified primarily in s. 690  Cr. C. Originally, in 1892, the forerunner
of this provision read as follows: 748. If upon any application for the mercy of the Crown on behalf
of any person convicted of an indictable offence, the Minister of Justice
entertains a doubt whether such person ought to have been convicted, he may, instead
of advising Her Majesty to remit or commute the sentence, after such inquiry as
he thinks proper, by an order in writing direct a new trial at such time
and before such court as he may think proper. (Criminal
Code, 1892, S.C. 1892, c. 29) [30]                         
The provision has evolved over time, but the
link between the referral procedure and the concept of mercy has always
remained, as can be seen from the words “upon an application for the mercy of
the Crown” (Criminal Code, S.C. 1953-54, c. 51, s. 596). In Therrien
(Re), 2001 SCC 35, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 113, Gonthier J. considered
the effect of a pardon, which he defined as “an expression of the sovereignty
of the monarch, the result of the unilateral and discretionary exercise of the
Royal prerogative of mercy or clemency”. He explained that in Canada, statutory
provisions merely set out various ways to exercise this prerogative but do not
limit its scope. The types of pardons include “the pardon granted after a
referral for hearing or referral to a court of appeal in accordance with s. 690
of the Code . . . which results in a new trial or a new hearing”: Therrien,
at para. 114. [31]                         
The fact that the Minister’s power derives from
the royal prerogative of mercy attests to the broad discretion that is
conferred on him or her. Although the fact that a decision is discretionary is
not on its own sufficient to justify finding that a public law immunity
applies, it is nonetheless a helpful criterion. [32]                         
Moreover, the various relevant provisions of the
Cr. C. over the years were all drafted in broad and general language.
They offered little guidance for the exercise of this discretion and
accordingly gave the Minister a great deal of latitude. They gave the Minister
the power to, inter alia, direct a new trial or refer the matter
to the court of appeal, and left it up to the Minister to determine in what
circumstances he or she should intervene: 596. The Minister of Justice may . . . (a) direct . . . a new trial
before any court that he thinks proper, if after inquiry he is
satisfied that in the circumstances a new trial should be directed; (Criminal Code , S.C. 1953-54) [33]                         
In making this discretionary decision, the
Minister necessarily had to assess and weigh public policy considerations on
the basis of social, political and economic factors. This power, which derived
from the royal prerogative, fell outside the traditional sphere of criminal law
in that it came into play after all judicial remedies had been exhausted. In
exercising it, the Minister had to be careful to avoid usurping the role of the
courts and short-circuiting the usual judicial process. It clearly did not
constitute a new level of appeal. As the Court of Appeal noted in the case at bar,
the Minister’s duties required [translation] . . . diverse (and often
diverging) legal and social interests, ranging from the specific interest of
the particular individual and a concern for justice to the preservation of the
independence and integrity of the judicial system and of the stability of
judgments — each of them being no less important than the others — to be
weighed [in relation to] facts that are seldom clear. [para. 141] [34]                         
Furthermore, Part XXI.1 of the Cr. C.,
which was introduced in 2002 by the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2001,
S.C. 2002, c. 13, s. 71 , has as its purposes to provide greater guidance for
the exercise of this power and to enhance the transparency of the process:
Library of Parliament, “Bill C-15A: An Act to amend the Criminal Code  and to
amend other Acts”, Legislative Summary LS-410E, October 12, 2001 (“Legislative
Summary”). Under the current s. 696.3(3) (a) Cr. C., the Minister
may now direct a new trial or refer the matter to the court of appeal “if the
Minister is satisfied that there is a reasonable basis to conclude that a
miscarriage of justice likely occurred”. Unlike when Mr. Hinse made his
applications, s. 696.4  Cr. C. now sets out specific criteria on which
the Minister’s decision must be based. Public policy considerations, such as
certainty of judgments and judicial independence, were taken into account when
the new provisions were enacted, and their importance in the Minister’s
decision-making process has been reduced. [35]                         
Finally, because the decision maker’s role may
also be a relevant factor in characterizing the power in question, it should be
borne in mind that the Minister, in making such policy decisions, does not act
as a mere public servant working in an administrative or operational capacity.
In this regard, the appellant’s argument that a distinction should be drawn
between the processing of applications for mercy by government employees and
the Minister’s decision is wrong. Such a distinction is both difficult to
justify and difficult to make in practice. This power is a single power — to
review a conviction — that cannot be split into two unconnected steps. Although
the ministerial review process does of course require administrative support,
this fact alone does not, in the case before us, justify dividing the process
into distinct compartments of policy decisions and operational decisions. The
decision to consider a case further or to deny an application is an integral
part of the evaluation process. [36]                         
The history and the nature of the Minister’s
power of mercy lead us to find that the exercise of that power was a true core
policy act at the relevant time. In light of the principles from Imperial
Tobacco, the exercise of such a power could not therefore expose the Crown
to liability unless the Minister acted irrationally or in bad faith. In the
instant case, it is not necessary to consider in detail what might constitute
an irrational decision by the Minister. That is not the issue Mr. Hinse raises
here. He merely complains of the failure to conduct adequate reviews of his
applications. What is really at issue in this case is whether the Minister
conducted a meaningful review. This means that it is important to define what
constitutes bad faith in Quebec civil law in the context of the case at bar. (3)       Characterization of the Fault [37]                         
Mr. Hinse maintains that the Minister’s conduct
when exercising his power of mercy must be assessed against a standard of
simple fault. In the alternative, he argues that the fault threshold required
to lift the Crown’s qualified immunity includes carelessness or serious
recklessness. The AGC counters that the Crown cannot be held liable in respect
of the Minister’s conduct absent “bad faith or other similar conduct”: R.F., at
paras. 43 and 51. At the hearing in this Court, the AGC conceded that bad faith
can be proven indirectly by showing conduct so blameworthy and inexplicable
that it cannot be concluded that the person in question acted in good faith,
since the only possible explanation is that he or she did so in bad faith. In
the AGC’s opinion, this is a very high threshold. A total failure by the
Minister to review an application for mercy would be one example of such
conduct: transcript, at pp. 77-78. [38]                         
The Superior Court, having found that the
Minister was not protected by any immunity, decided on and applied a standard
of simple fault. The Court of Appeal, being of the opinion that the Minister’s
actions were protected by an immunity, preferred to apply the malice standard
developed in the context of the liability of Crown prosecutors for malicious
prosecution. It pointed to the similarities between the Minister’s duties and
those of prosecutors. It did not rule definitively on the issue, however, as in
its view, the appellant had not proven that a fault of any kind had been
committed: paras. 150-57. (a)      
Applicable Standard of Fault Is Not Malice [39]                         
In our opinion, it would be inappropriate to
import the malice standard applicable to the liability of Crown prosecutors for
malicious prosecution into a case concerning an application for mercy. Although
there is a certain similarity between the duties discharged by the Minister in
exercising his or her power of mercy and those discharged by Crown prosecutors
in exercising their discretion in criminal prosecutions, there are significant
differences between the two roles. [40]                         
First, although it is possible, in rare cases,
to hold Crown prosecutors liable for malicious prosecution, there are policy
reasons that justify an extremely high threshold for success in such an action:
Miazga v. Kvello Estate, 2009 SCC 51, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 339, at para. 43; Proulx
v. Quebec (Attorney General), 2001 SCC 66, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 9, at para. 4; Nelles
v. Ontario, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 170. As a result, an action for malicious
prosecution must be based on malice or on an improper purpose: Miazga,
at paras. 56 and 81. The decision to initiate or continue criminal proceedings
lies at the core of the Crown prosecutor’s powers, and the principle of
independence of the prosecutor’s office shields prosecutors from the influence
of improper political factors: Miazga, at para. 45; see also Krieger
v. Law Society of Alberta, 2002 SCC 65, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 372. Prosecutors
must be able to act independently of any political pressure from the government
and must be beyond the reach of judicial review, except in cases of abuse of
process. This independence is so fundamental to the integrity and efficiency of
the criminal justice system that it is constitutionally entrenched: Miazga,
at para. 46; Krieger, at paras. 30-32. [41]                         
The imposition of a high fault threshold thus
flows from an intentional choice made to preserve a balance “between the right
of individual citizens to be free from groundless criminal prosecutions and the
public interest in the effective and uninhibited prosecution of criminal
wrongdoing”: Miazga, at para. 52. [42]                         
These policy reasons do not apply to the
Minister’s power of mercy, however. Although this power is a highly
discretionary one, the Minister’s latitude in deciding whether to exercise it
is not fundamental to the integrity and efficiency of the criminal justice
system per se. Indeed, the mercy process [translation] “begins where the law ends”: Bilodeau v.
Canada (Ministre de la Justice), 2009 QCCA 746, [2009] R.J.Q. 1003, at
para. 14; see also Thatcher v. Canada (Attorney General), [1997] 1 F.C.
289 (T.D.), at para. 9. Furthermore, although prosecutorial authority must be
shielded from political influence, the Minister must weigh social, political
and economic factors in making his or her decision. As well, the Minister’s
independence in the context of this decision-making process is not entrenched
in the Constitution. [43]                         
Second, it must be borne in mind that the
exercise of the royal prerogative, like the exercise of any other statutory
power, can be reviewed by the courts. Ministerial decisions on applications for
mercy are therefore subject to judicial review: Operation Dismantle Inc. v.
The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R.
441; P. W. Hogg, P. J. Monahan and W. K. Wright, Liability of the
Crown (4th ed. 2011), at p. 26; see also Bilodeau v. Canada (Minister of
Justice), 2011 FC 886, 394 F.T.R. 235; Daoulov v. Canada (Attorney
General), 2009 FCA 12, 388 N.R. 54; Bilodeau (QCCA); Timm v.
Canada (Attorney General), 2012 FC 505, 409 F.T.R. 8, aff’d 2012 FCA 282,
451 N.R. 250; Thatcher. This is generally not the case for Crown
prosecutors’ decisions on whether to prosecute. [44]                         
A comparison between the prosecutorial
prerogative of Crown prosecutors and the evolution of
the Minister’s power of mercy under the Cr. C. reveals significant
differences between the contents of the two prerogatives. This means that these
prerogatives must be analyzed from different perspectives. [45]                         
Third, what is at issue in the instant case is
whether the general Quebec rules of extracontractual civil liability apply to
the federal Crown, as provided for in the C.L.P.A. Intent is not usually
a prerequisite for establishing such liability. Even where gross fault is
alleged, intent is not required, unlike in the case of the tort of malicious
prosecution, for which intent must be proven. [46]                         
Finally, we note that the AGC did not insist on
this very high standard at the hearing in this Court. [47]                         
It is therefore our opinion that to assess the
Minister’s conduct in the exercise of his power of mercy, it would be
inappropriate to apply a standard of fault that limits bad faith to malice. The
bad faith referred to in Imperial Tobacco to circumscribe the qualified
immunity of the Crown for acts of political authority does not require such a
result. (b)      Applicable
Standard of Fault in This Case [48]                         
In Quebec civil law, the concept of bad faith is
flexible, and its content varies from one area of the law to another: Entreprises
Sibeca Inc. v. Frelighsburg (Municipality), 2004 SCC 61, [2004] 3 S.C.R.
304, at para. 25. In Finney, this Court defined the scope of a statutory
immunity according to which the Barreau du Québec could not be prosecuted for
acts carried out in good faith. The Court held that bad faith is broader than
just intentional fault or a demonstrated intent to harm another: para. 37. It
also encompasses serious recklessness. LeBel J. wrote the following: . . .
recklessness implies a fundamental breakdown of the orderly exercise of
authority, to the point that absence of good faith can be deduced and bad faith
presumed. The act, in terms of how it is performed, is then inexplicable
and incomprehensible, to the point that it can be regarded as an actual
abuse of power, having regard to the purposes for which it is meant to be
exercised. [Emphasis added; para. 39.] [49]                         
In Sibeca, this Court applied the
definition of bad faith from Finney in the context of the qualified
immunity that protects a municipality when exercising its regulatory
discretion. Deschamps J.’s comments on the nature of that discretion can be
transposed to the instant case: Municipalities
perform functions that require them to take multiple and sometimes conflicting
interests into consideration. To ensure that political disputes are resolved
democratically to the extent possible, elected public bodies must have
considerable latitude. Where no constitutional issues are in play, it would be
inconceivable for the courts to interfere in this process and set themselves up
as arbitrators to dictate that any particular interest be taken into
consideration. They may intervene only if there is evidence of bad faith. The
onerous and complex nature of the functions that are inherent in the exercise
of a regulatory power justifies incorporating a form of protection both in
civil law and at common law. [para. 24] [50]                         
In Deschamps J.’s view, the interpretation of
bad faith proposed in Finney is applicable both to cases in which acts
were committed deliberately with intent to harm and to those in which
circumstantial evidence of bad faith must be relied on: Sibeca, at para.
26. [51]                         
In our opinion, a standard of bad faith that
encompasses serious recklessness as defined in Finney and applied in Sibeca
is consistent with the logic of Quebec’s principles of civil liability.
Moreover, this standard is akin to the concept of gross fault, which includes
gross recklessness: see art. 1474 C.C.Q.; J.-L. Baudouin, P. Deslauriers
and B. Moore, La responsabilité civile (8th ed. 2014), at No. 1-190. [52]                         
This standard is of course higher than the
standard of simple fault that the trial judge incorrectly applied in the case
at bar. A simple fault such as a mistake or a careless act does not correspond
to the concept of bad faith that defines the limits of the Crown’s qualified
immunity. Moreover, it would be paradoxical if the exercise of the Minister’s
power of mercy were subject to a reasonableness standard on judicial review
while being considered from the standpoint of a simple fault in extracontractual
liability. [53]                         
In sum, decisions of the Minister that are made
in bad faith, including those demonstrating serious recklessness — as defined
in Finney and Sibeca — on the Minister’s part, fall outside the
Crown’s qualified immunity. Bad faith can be established by proving that the
Minister acted deliberately with the specific intent to harm another person. It
can also be established by proof of serious recklessness that reveals a
breakdown of the orderly exercise of authority so fundamental that absence of good
faith can be deduced and bad faith presumed. It is with this in mind that the
duty owed by the Minister when exercising his or her power of mercy must be
analyzed. (4)      Minister’s Duty [54]                         
The trial judge held that the Crown’s
extracontractual liability under art. 1457 C.C.Q. is based on [translation] “the breach of a duty
flowing from the conduct required of a reasonable person in society”: para. 32.
She found that when the Minister exercises the power of mercy, he or she has a
duty to react as quickly as possible when evidence of a miscarriage of justice
arises: para. 68. At a minimum, this duty requires the Minister to conduct a
meaningful review of applications for mercy, since he or she has the powers of
a commissioner under Part I of the Inquiries Act,  R.S.C. 1985, c. I-11: para. 71. The trial judge described the meaningful review as a “thorough” investigation (para. 95) or a
“sustained, concerted [and] extensive . . . review” (para. 75). [55]                         
The Court of Appeal concluded that the trial
judge had erred in law in defining the scope of the Minister’s duty at the time
of Mr. Hinse’s initial application for mercy on the basis of current standards
and practices: para. 165. It instead found that the scope of that duty had been
correctly defined in Thatcher: paras. 166-68. When presented with an
application for mercy that was neither frivolous nor vexatious, the Minister
was required to conduct a meaningful review of it, although not a review
equivalent to the one that would be expected from a police investigation or a commission
of inquiry. [56]                         
In our opinion, the Court of Appeal was right,
in defining the scope of the Minister’s duty at the relevant time, to endorse
the conclusions reached by the Federal Court in Thatcher, to mention
that the Minister was under no obligation to give reasons for his or her
decisions, and to point out that good faith on the Minister’s part had to be
presumed: para. 170. [57]                         
Mr. Hinse’s applications for mercy were made to
the Minister between 1967 and 1990, and the response to his final application
was sent to him in April 1991, that is, before the C.C.Q. came into
force in 1994. It will therefore be necessary to refer to the standard that was
provided for in art. 1053 of the Civil Code of Lower Canada (“C.C.L.C.”)
(now art. 1457 C.C.Q.), which was in force at the time of the facts
alleged against the AGC: Every person
capable of discerning right from wrong is responsible for the damage caused by
his fault to another, whether by positive act, imprudence, neglect or want of
skill. [58]                         
Under the C.L.P.A. , the federal Crown can
be held liable not on its own account, but solely for the fault of its servants
(in this case, the Minister): s. 3(a)(i). In Quebec civil law, it was
art. 1054 C.C.L.C. — now art. 1463 C.C.Q. — that provided for
this type of liability. However, this liability scheme was based on the same
concept of fault as the one described in the general provisions on
extracontractual liability, or, in this case, art. 1053 C.C.L.C. [59]                         
To define the duty owed by the Minister when
exercising his or her power of mercy, we must take the Cr. C. and the
procedure that applied at the material time into account. These factors will
make it possible to establish a general definition of the scope of that duty. [60]                         
In finding that the Minister is protected by a
qualified immunity, we noted that the Cr. C.’s successive provisions on
mercy that applied during the relevant period (from 1967 to 1990) granted the
Minister a broad discretion. Regardless of the amendments Parliament made over
the years to the section of the Cr. C. that conferred this power on the
Minister, the wording remained essentially the same: “The Minister of Justice may,
upon an application for the mercy of the Crown . . . .” These various sections
did not include the verb “shall” in relation to the Minister’s powers, and
nowhere in them was any specific duty imposed on the Minister. [61]                         
We also mentioned that Parliament left it up to
the Minister to decide on the circumstances in which it would be appropriate to
direct a new trial or refer the matter to the court of appeal. Ideally,
Parliament could have defined the types of circumstances that were relevant and
given better guidance on the procedure the Minister was to follow. But it did
not do so. This reflects Parliament’s choice to give the Minister considerable
latitude and must be taken into account when defining the scope of the
Minister’s duty. [62]                         
As we mentioned above, Parliament modified the
power of mercy significantly in 2002, choosing to provide greater guidance for
the exercise of the power. Since then, the Minister has been required to review
applications for mercy in accordance with the Regulations Respecting
Applications for Ministerial Review — Miscarriages of Justice, SOR/2002-416:
s. 696.2 Cr. C. The Minister is also required to submit an annual report
to Parliament in relation to such applications: s. 696.5 Cr. C. This
change underlines the fact that there was no applicable procedural framework
when Mr. Hinse made his applications for mercy. Moreover, the following appears
in the Legislative Summary: Prior to 1994, the Department of Justice took a more or less ad
hoc approach to section 690  applications. There was no set procedure
or designated personnel to deal with them. . . . . . . In 1994, the Department of Justice instituted a number of measures
to address complaints about the section 690  application process. [Emphasis
added; pp. 17-18.] [63]                         
While the procedure to be followed is now more
detailed, it does not actually require the Minister to conduct an investigation
in every case. Section 3 of the Regulations provides that the Minister
must conduct a preliminary assessment of the application. After that, the
Minister is in principle required to conduct an investigation only “if [he or
she] determines that there may be a reasonable basis to conclude that a
miscarriage of justice likely occurred”: s. 4 of the Regulations. Finally, unlike with
the powers the Minister had at the material time in this case, he or she now
has and may exercise the powers of a commissioner under Part I of the Inquiries Act  and the powers that may be
conferred on a commissioner under s. 11 of that Act: s. 696.2(2)  Cr. C. [64]                         
In light of the applicable provisions of the Cr.
C. and of the fact that there was, at the relevant time, no established
procedure to guide the Minister in exercising his or her power of mercy, we,
like the Court of Appeal, agree with the conclusions of Rothstein J. (then a
judge of the Federal Court — Trial Division) in Thatcher regarding the
scope of the Minister’s duty. Thatcher concerned an application for
judicial review of a decision to deny an application for mercy made under s. 690 
Cr. C. and, therefore, the scope of the duty of fairness the Minister
owed when exercising the power. Although that is not the issue in the instant
case, Rothstein J.’s analysis of the Minister’s power was nonetheless correct,
and his conclusions will be helpful in determining the scope of the Minister’s
duty in the context of the Crown’s civil liability. [65]                         
Rothstein J. began by indicating that the mercy
procedure is not the subject of legal rights, as it is initiated only after a
convicted person has exhausted his or her rights: Thatcher, at para. 9.
He then made the following observation: That the
function of the Minister of Justice under section 690  is an “exemplar of a
purely discretionary act” is reflected in the wide allowance given to the
Minister to exercise his discretion. There are no statutory provisions
directing the Minister as to the manner in which he should exercise his
discretion. There are no requirements as to the type of investigation the
Minister must carry out under section 690 . [para. 10] [66]                         
Rothstein J. pointed out that no procedure had
been established and that the Minister’s decision was not subject to appeal: Thatcher,
at para. 11. He concluded that “the Minister must act in good faith and conduct
a meaningful review, provided that the application is not frivolous or
vexatious”: para. 13. An application usually had to introduce some new matter
“indicating it is likely that there has been a miscarriage of justice”: para. 14.
Rothstein J. stated that the applicant had no general right to disclosure of
what the Minister or his officials had considered in their review: para. 13.
However, the applicant was entitled to disclosure of any new information
uncovered by the Minister’s investigation: para. 14. [67]                         
Finally, Rothstein J. wrote: Exceptionally, as a result of new information that is substantial and would
provide a reasonable basis for a finding of miscarriage of justice, the
Minister may find it necessary to consider material in police or prosecution
files. In such a case, the material, or at least the gist of the material the
Minister or his officials review, if not already known by the applicant, would
have to be disclosed to him. But there is no general obligation on the
Minister to review police and prosecution files or to disclose those files
merely because of a request by a convicted person. [Emphasis added.] (Thatcher,
at para. 15) [68]                         
It is our opinion that, for the purpose of
establishing liability under the Quebec rules of extracontractual liability,
the Minister’s duty can be defined in terms of a meaningful review of an
application for mercy. What a meaningful review entails must be understood in
light of Rothstein J.’s comments. It is not the extensive and thorough review
referred to by Poulin J. As well, this review is clearly not intended to be
equivalent to a new level of appeal. And it is inappropriate to compare the
Minister’s review to a police investigation or to the work of a commission of
inquiry. On the other hand, a slapdash investigation could hardly be described
as a meaningful one either. It goes without saying that, as the AGC agreed at
the hearing, a total failure to conduct a meaningful review of an application
that is neither frivolous nor vexatious would constitute a breach of the
Minister’s duty. In addition, as we concluded above that it is inappropriate to
draw a distinction between the processing of an application for mercy and the
Minister’s decision with respect to that application, these two aspects of the
power of mercy are intrinsically linked. The duty to conduct a meaningful
review therefore entails a duty to make a decision in good faith on the basis
of the evidence uncovered by that review. Finally, we would add that at the
time, the Minister did not have to document his or her investigation or give
any reasons whatsoever for his or her discretionary decision. This fact will be
important for our assessment of the evidence that has been submitted. [69]                         
Since we have concluded that the Minister is
protected by a qualified immunity when exercising his or her power of mercy,
only a breach of the Minister’s duty that amounts to bad faith or serious
recklessness could expose the Crown to liability. In short, the evidence had to
show that the Minister had acted in bad faith or with serious recklessness in
conducting the required review of Mr. Hinse’s applications for mercy. B.      
Evidence of Fault in This Case [70]                         
Although the basis for the Crown’s
extracontractual liability in respect of the Minister’s conduct is governed by
the C.C.L.C., it is the C.C.Q. that governs the rules of evidence
and procedure in this case: ss. 2 and 3 of the Act respecting the
implementation of the reform of the Civil Code (see also the second para. of
s. 9). Article  2803 C.C.Q. provides that “[a] person seeking to assert
a right shall prove the facts on which his claim is based.” The onus was
therefore on Mr. Hinse to prove fault on the AGC’s part, damage he himself had
suffered, and a causal connection between the two: see J.-C. Royer and S. Lavallée,
La preuve civile (4th ed. 2008), at No. 158. [71]                         
In this case, there is no direct evidence
regarding the quality of the Minister’s review. The appellant’s argument was
based on proof by presumption of fact, and the trial judge relied on this
argument to conclude that the Minister had not conducted a meaningful review.
Article 2846 C.C.Q. provides that “[a] presumption is an inference drawn
by the law or the court from a known fact to an unknown fact.” Regarding
presumptions of fact, art. 2849 C.C.Q. provides that courts may, at
their discretion, take such presumptions into account, but only if they are
“serious, precise and concordant”. These modifiers can be defined as follows: [translation]  Presumptions are
serious when the connection between the known fact and the unknown fact is
such that the existence of one establishes the existence of the other in a
clear and obvious manner. . . . Presumptions
are precise when the conclusions that flow from the
known fact tend to establish the contested unknown fact in a direct and
specific manner. If it were also possible to draw different and even contrary
results, to infer the existence of various and contradictory facts, the
presumptions would not be precise in nature and would give rise only to doubt
and uncertainty. Finally, they
are concordant, whether or not they each spring
from a common or different source, when they tend[, as a whole and in how they
accord with one another,] to establish the fact to be proven. . . . If, on the
contrary, they contradict each other . . . and cancel each other out, they are
no longer concordant, and create only doubt in the magistrate’s mind. [Emphasis
added.] (M. L. Larombière, Théorie et pratique des obligations (new ed. 1885), vol. 7, at p. 216, reproduced in Barrette v. Union canadienne, compagnie d’assurances, 2013 QCCA 1687, [2013] R.J.Q. 1577, at para. 33; France Animation s.a. v. Robinson, 2011 QCCA 1361, at
para. 120 (CanLII), quoting Longpré v. Thériault, [1979] C.A. 258, at p.
262.) [72]                         
Thus, [translation]
“[a] presumption of fact cannot be deduced from a pure hypothesis, from
speculation, from vague suspicions or from mere conjecture”: Royer and
Lavallée, at No. 842, citing Crispino v. General Accident Insurance Company,
2007 QCCA 1293, [2007] R.R.A. 847. An unknown fact will not be proven if the
known facts cause another fact that is inconsistent with the fact the plaintiff
wants to prove to be more or less likely, or if they do not reasonably rule out
another possible cause of the damage he or she suffered: see, e.g., Crispino.
However, it is not necessary to rule out every other possibility: Royer and
Lavallée, at No. 842; see also St-Yves v. Laurentienne générale, compagnie
d’assurance inc., 1997 CanLII 10732 (Que. C.A.). [73]                         
After reviewing the steps taken by Mr. Hinse and
the authorities’ responses, Poulin J. concluded that [translation] “the federal government’s conduct was marked by
institutional indifference”: para. 55. She made the following points, inter
alia, in this regard: -
    despite the multiple and urgent distress calls Mr. Hinse sent out, no one
really listened to him, no one helped him, no one looked into his allegations,
no one tried to validate them; -
    even though he was acquitted by this Court in 1997, and despite the Quebec
government’s proposal, the federal government refused to compensate him in
accordance with the Guidelines: Compensation for Wrongfully Convicted and
Imprisoned Persons (1988) (“Guidelines”); and -
    the AGC contested Mr. Hinse’s action firmly and vigorously for more than 13
years, thereby perpetuating the miscarriage of justice (paras. 57 and 59-60). [74]                         
Poulin J. then expressed the opinion that [translation] “the federal government is
liable for the faults committed by its servants and agents, manifested
primarily in their indifference toward him”: para. 61. In this regard, she
notably criticized the federal government for a number of actions: -
    it let more than a year and a half go by and did not respond to the
appellant’s first application for review until it had received the third letter
from the appellant or his spouse; -
    it created confusion in the instructions it gave them; -
    it misled the appellant by referring him to the provincial authorities on
several occasions; -
    it deliberately caused the appellant to lose precious time; -
    it repeatedly asked the appellant to tell his story; and -
    it forwarded documents the appellant had sent to it to third parties who
were not involved in his case (para. 63). [75]                         
Moreover, Poulin J. expressed the opinion that
the AGC had had a duty to react as quickly as possible to Mr. Hinse’s
application for mercy, as a wrongful conviction is a flagrant example of a
miscarriage of justice: para. 68. In her view, the Minister [translation] “had at the very least a
duty to conduct a meaningful review of Hinse’s review applications simply
because he ‘has and may exercise the powers of a commissioner under Part I of
the Inquiries Act ’”: para. 71, quoting s. 696.2(2)  Cr. C. She added that
the Minister should, in exercising his power, have taken into account certain
concerns raised in an article published in 1992, in which Philip Rosen
describes the procedure followed when an application for mercy is sent to the
Minister: para. 72, citing Library of Parliament, “Wrongful Convictions in the
Criminal Justice System”, Background Paper BP-285E, January 1992, at pp. 10-11.
Poulin J. observed that this exercise had “clearly” not been undertaken in this
case, which amounts to a fault of omission: para. 73. [76]                         
She concluded her remarks regarding fault as
follows: [translation] The evidence that Hinse
adduced by presumption of fact satisfies the Court that the AGC’s wrongful
inaction compounded his suffering. . . . Institutional inertia exacerbated and
extended it by perpetuating the impact of the criminal past that the whole of
society had attached to Hinse for a robbery he had not committed, whereas the
AGC was the only one in a position to remedy the injustice. That, it should
be repeated, is where his fault lies. [paras. 75-76] [77]                         
The Court of Appeal found that the Minister had
had a duty to conduct a meaningful review of Mr. Hinse’s case, because the
affidavits submitted by Mr. Hinse had indicated that a miscarriage of justice
may have occurred. The court acknowledged that it was difficult [translation] “to accurately gauge what
kind of study was conducted, because of the summary nature of the evidence
adduced”, but nevertheless inferred nothing negative from that: para. 170. At
the time in question, the Minister had not been under an obligation to give
reasons for his or her decisions, and good faith on his or her part was
presumed. In the court’s view, the evidence in the record did not justify the
trial judge’s inferring from the refusals Mr. Hinse had met with that the
Ministers had not conducted a meaningful review or had acted maliciously: para.
177. The Court of Appeal pointed out that when Mr. Hinse had made his
applications, he had not yet exhausted his legal remedies, and that at his
trial, Judge Côté had made some very harsh comments regarding his credibility:
paras. 168-69. Finally, the court stated that, even if it considered the
handling of all Mr. Hinse’s applications globally, it could not identify any
wrongful conduct: para. 183. [78]                         
The appellant submits that the trial judge did
not err in law in defining the meaningful review standard. In his view, it can
be seen from Thatcher and from Wilson v. Minister of Justice,
[1983] 2 F.C. 379 (T.D.), aff’d [1985] 1 F.C. 586 (C.A.), that in those cases, Department
of Justice officials had conducted exhaustive investigations and reviews, and [translation] “[t]he contrast between the
work carried out in those cases and the total absence of any documentation
and/or any information showing any enquiry whatsoever carried out by the AGC in
this case is striking”: A.F., at para. 58 (emphasis deleted). The respondent
contends that the trial judge erred in law by reviewing the Minister’s conduct
on the basis of the provisions of the Cr. C. that came into force in 2002
and the practices followed in the 1990s. She should have conducted this review
on the basis of the standards that applied at the time of the acts in question.
The respondent relies on the conclusions reached in Thatcher to himself
conclude that the Minister’s conduct in the case at bar was not wrongful. [79]                         
We are of the opinion that the trial judge not
only erred in finding that no immunity whatsoever applied to the Minister’s
exercise of his power, but also made several errors regarding the scope of the Minister’s
duty, and that those errors led her to conclude, incorrectly, that the Minister
had committed a fault. We will discuss the errors in question first, before
turning to the determinative issue of the allegation that the Minister failed
to conduct a meaningful review. (1)     
Anachronism in the Scope of the Minister’s Duty [80]                         
The Court of Appeal was right to find that
Poulin J. had erred in considering the powers of a commissioner under the Inquiries
Act  as a basis for determining whether the review conducted by the Minister
was a meaningful one. Those powers were not conferred on the Minister until
2002, when Parliament reformed the procedure in respect of applications for
mercy. As the Court of Appeal pointed out, this anachronism had distorted
Poulin J.’s analysis of the nature of the meaningful review the Minister was
required to conduct, as she had found that the Minister had [translation] “extremely broad” latitude
in this regard and could seek assistance from the RCMP, from local police
forces and from forensic scientists or other experts: para. 71, citing Rosen,
at p. 11. As was established in Thatcher, however, the Minister would be
required to consult the files of the prosecutor or of the police only in
exceptional circumstances. In our opinion, requiring the Minister to assume the
role of a police investigator or to enlist the aid of such investigators or any
other experts would have been even less appropriate. [81]                         
Similarly, as the Court of Appeal observed, the
1992 study by Philip Rosen could be helpful, but not determinative, in the
analysis of the Minister’s conduct: para. 165. Although Rosen briefly reviewed
the history of the Minister’s power, his study was really limited to s. 690 Cr.
C., the Department of Justice’s “present practice” (i.e. the one followed
since 1985), problems with that practice, and proposals for change. But s. 690 Cr.
C. did not come into force until 1988, whereas Mr. Hinse made the first
three of his applications before that date. As for the fourth application,
which he made in 1990, it is enough at this point to note that Mr. Hinse did
not meet with a firm refusal from the Minister then in office; rather, the
Minister asked Mr. Hinse to seek relief directly from the Quebec Court of
Appeal, and to contact her again if he was unsuccessful: A.R., vol. XI, at p. 75. [82]                         
In his study, Rosen discussed problems with the
Department of Justice’s “present practice” that the lawyers of certain
applicants had denounced. Those problems confirm some of the criticisms of the
Minister made by Mr. Hinse and the trial judge, which included the following
(pp. 13-14): -
    a lack of established rules of procedure; -
    issues with respect to the types of evidence and documents collected by the
Department and the nature of the report submitted to the Minister; -
    concerns about the fact that applicants or their counsel were not advised
of adverse findings and allowed to make further legal or evidentiary responses
before the investigation report was submitted to the Minister; and -
    the Minister’s response to an application for mercy, which might not
provide the reasons for rejecting the application in sufficient detail. (2)      Confusion of the Minister’s Conduct With That of the AGC [83]                         
Furthermore, Poulin J. sometimes confused the
Minister’s actions with those of the AGC. Thus, she faulted the AGC for
vigorously contesting Mr. Hinse’s action and for asserting in his oral argument
that there was no evidence showing beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Hinse had
not committed the crime: paras. 60, 64 and 66. Although the AGC is the
Minister’s representative for the purposes of this proceeding, it is important
to distinguish the conduct of the former from that of the latter. It is the
Minister’s conduct that must be reviewed to determine whether the federal Crown
is civilly liable. In the part of her judgment dealing with fault, the judge
should have confined her analysis to the Minister’s conduct. If the criticisms
levelled against the AGC regarding the conduct of the litigation are at all
relevant, it is only for the purpose of determining whether there was an abuse
of process, which is an issue that must be considered separately. (3)      Federal Crown’s Obligation to Compensate [84]                         
Canada has recognized that it is desirable to
compensate victims of miscarriages of justice. In particular, it acceded to the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 999 U.N.T.S. 171 (“ICCPR”),
which provides, in art. 14(6): When a person
has by a final decision been convicted of a criminal offence and when
subsequently his conviction has been reversed or he has been pardoned on the
ground that a new or newly discovered fact shows conclusively that there has
been a miscarriage of justice, the person who has suffered punishment as a
result of such conviction shall be compensated according to law, unless it is
proved that the non-disclosure of the unknown fact in time is wholly or partly
attributable to him. (Entry into
force, March 23, 1976; accession by Canada, May 19, 1976.) [85]                         
However, Canada has not enacted legislation to
incorporate the ICCPR into Canadian domestic law. There is no
legislation establishing an obligation for the federal government or the
provinces to compensate victims of miscarriages of justice, nor is there any
legislation establishing a right to such compensation. The federal and
provincial governments did adopt the Guidelines in 1988. The Guidelines
establish a set of criteria that a wrongfully convicted person must meet to be
entitled to compensation. In addition to fixing the maximum amount of such
compensation, they require, inter alia, that the person first receive a
statement to the effect that he or she is innocent: a free pardon or the
quashing of a guilty verdict is not, on its own, sufficient. The Guidelines
are not binding legislation, however, and have never been regarded as such:
see, e.g., S. L. Robins, In the Matter of Steven Truscott: Advisory
Opinion on the Issue of Compensation, March 28, 2008 (online), at pp. 18-23. [86]                         
As a result, the Guidelines did not
require the federal government to compensate Mr. Hinse, particularly
given that his “factual innocence” had not been proven. Moreover, Quebec had
decided not to compensate the appellant for this very reason: examination on
discovery of D. Grégoire, May 28, 2009, R.R., vol. II, at pp. 89-90, 94-96 and
99. The trial judge therefore could not hold this against the AGC when
assessing the alleged fault. (4)     
Refusal Based on the Earlier Applications [87]                         
The trial judge faulted
the federal authorities for denying subsequent applications on the basis of the
original refusal:                     [translation]  Even though they had fresh
evidence establishing that he was the victim of a miscarriage of justice, the
federal authorities based their subsequent refusals on the rejection of the
initial application. [Footnotes omitted; para. 74.] [88]                         
In support of this conclusion, she relied on the
following excerpts from the examination of Kerry Scullion, Director and General
Counsel for the Criminal Conviction Review Board of the Department of Justice,
who represented the AGC: -   Do you know what the federal government did after that? -   If he’s
repeating the same claims that he made in the previous applications,
probably not much. There would be no further reviews if the same material is being put
forward in support of subsequent applications as what was put forward in past
applications that were denied. It probably wouldn’t
go any further than somebody having reviewed what was done in the past and a letter written back saying . . . . I mean
you have to look at it to see if there is something new as to what was
maintained in the previous
ones, but other than that, that would be the extent of it. It looks like
something was written back to him possibly. . . . -   So basically, Mr. Hinse’s request is once
again turned down? -   Yes. There
would have been nothing new from the last request. [Emphasis added.] (A.R., vol.
VII, at pp. 164-65) [89]                         
In our opinion, the comments the trial judge
attributed to the AGC’s representative must be qualified. It is true that the
AGC’s representative stated that if Mr. Hinse had submitted new applications to
the Minister without raising any new facts or evidence, then the subsequent
refusals would very likely have been due to the first refusal. [90]                         
With respect, however, these statements do not
establish that, in the instant case, the Ministers failed to consider what was
described as fresh evidence. It should be borne in mind that the Minister’s
duty is owed in respect only of serious applications and that such an
application will usually arise from some new matter indicating that it is
likely there has been a miscarriage of justice: Thatcher, at para. 14.
Absent exceptional circumstances, the Minister may deny a new application for
mercy on the basis of previous refusals if the new application does not
introduce any new facts or issues. (5)      Fault of Institutional Inertia or Indifference [91]                         
At trial, Mr. Hinse linked the fault allegedly
committed by the federal authorities to what his counsel described as [translation] “institutional
indifference”: paras. 33, 40 and 52. Poulin J. summarized Mr. Hinse’s position
in this regard as follows:                     [translation] More specifically, he
submits that the government acted wrongfully toward him for over 40 years by
failing to act as a competent, prudent and diligent authority would have done,
given that it knew or ought to have known about the miscarriage of justice of
which he was the unfortunate victim and that it could not therefore have been
unaware that its failure to act was exacerbating the damage Hinse was
sustaining. [para. 33] Although Poulin J.
referred to specific, time-limited wrongful actions, she ultimately characterized
the AGC’s fault as one of “institutional inertia” (para. 75; see also para. 209)
or “institutional indifference” (paras. 55, 89, 149 and 203), as if there were
one continuous fault that subsumed the individual actions of the successive
Ministers. In her view, this “institutional inertia” had exacerbated and
extended the duration of the miscarriage of justice of which Mr. Hinse was the
victim, and that was the essence of the AGC’s fault: paras. 75-76. [92]                         
To thus characterize the fault as one of “institutional
inertia” or “institutional indifference” amounted to accusing the federal Crown
itself of a fault. But under the C.L.P.A. , the federal Crown cannot be
held liable for its own actions, but is only liable in respect of the fault of
its servants (in this case, the Minister): s. 3(a)(i). The trial judge
erred in approaching the issue of the federal Crown’s civil liability from the
perspective of a fault of institutional inertia or indifference. She should
instead have analyzed the individual conduct of each of the successive
Ministers acting in his or her capacity as a servant of the federal Crown. (6)      Alleged Failure to Conduct a Meaningful Review [93]                         
Regarding the alleged failure to conduct
meaningful reviews of Mr. Hinse’s applications for mercy, we will begin by
pointing out that Poulin J. erred in law first in finding that a simple fault
on the Minister’s part had exposed the Crown to liability. She then erred in law a second time when she determined that the
Minister’s duty at the relevant time was to conduct a [translation] “sustained, concerted [and] extensive . . .
review” or a “thorough investigation”: paras. 75 and 95. Her finding of fault
on the Minister’s part must be attributed to these two errors. The analysis of
Mr. Hinse’s applications must be reconsidered in light of both the duty the
Ministers owed at the relevant time and the applicable standard of civil fault. [94]                         
Before doing so, we must make two preliminary
remarks. First, given the scope of the meaningful review the Minister was
required to conduct, the appellant is wrong to compare the reviews conducted in
his case to the ones conducted in Thatcher and Wilson. Mr. Hinse
submits that [translation] “[t]he
contrast between the work carried out in those cases and the total absence of
any documentation and/or any information showing any enquiry whatsoever carried
out by the AGC in this case is striking”: A.F., at para. 58 (emphasis deleted).
He points out that in Thatcher, counsel for the Department prepared a
draft investigative summary that included the trial evidence, the appellate
proceedings, the material provided by the applicant, and other information
gathered during the investigation. Counsel sent this summary to the applicant’s
lawyer, who had a chance to make further submissions, and the Minister rendered
a detailed 73-page decision. [95]                         
In the case at bar, Mr. Hinse had the
opportunity to introduce any new facts or evidence he wished to present in
order to flesh out his applications for mercy. The federal authorities asked
him several times to provide specific facts to support his application. Mr. Hinse
had a “reasonable opportunity to state his case”: Thatcher, at para. 13.
This being said, it should be borne in mind that under the law as it then
stood, the Minister was under no obligation to provide Mr. Hinse with an
investigative summary or to give reasons for his or her decision. [96]                         
In Wilson, there had been newspaper
reports suggesting that members of the jury had been involved in improprieties.
The provincial attorney general had therefore ordered a police investigation,
which led him to conclude that no offences had been committed. Mr. Wilson
submitted an application for mercy, and federal officials asked him several
times for additional information that was needed. The Minister ultimately
refused to exercise his power of mercy in Mr. Wilson’s favour. In his refusal
letter, he stated that he had reviewed Mr. Wilson’s submissions, information
obtained in the provincial attorney general’s investigation, and other
information gathered in the course of inquiries made at his own request. [97]                         
At that time, however, absent exceptional
circumstances, the Minister was under no obligation to consult the files of the
prosecutor or the police, let alone to contact other sources or to organize any
investigation whatsoever. The fact that the Minister decided to do so in Mr. Wilson’s
case does not mean that he should have done the same in Mr. Hinse’s case. It is
important to note that the Minister had a broad discretion in exercising his or
her power of mercy. It was open to the Minister to take special or additional
measures if he or she deemed it appropriate to do so. But that could not create
a legitimate expectation that he or she was to do so in every case. [98]                         
The second remark concerns the appellant’s
argument that there is no documentary or testimonial evidence attesting to any
review whatsoever having been conducted in his case. In his oral argument in
this Court, counsel for the appellant noted that his client had demanded that
the AGC turn over any documents confirming that a meaningful review had been
conducted in his case, and that he was told that he had been provided with all
the documentation there was. His client had therefore done all that he could,
because only the Minister could really prove what sort of review he had
conducted: transcript, at pp. 19-20. In the absence of such evidence, counsel
argued, the trial judge was right to find that there had been no review. [99]                         
It should be pointed out, however, that in this
situation, the burden of proof was on Mr. Hinse. It was therefore up to him to
establish the Minister’s fault, that is, a breach equivalent to bad faith or
serious recklessness in the review of the applications for mercy. He could of
course present evidence by presumption of fact that would lead the court to
infer that a meaningful review had not been conducted, or that one had been
conducted in bad faith or with serious recklessness. Nevertheless, that burden
was on him, and it was up to him to discharge it. This is particularly significant
as regards Mr. Hinse’s first application. At the hearing, counsel for the
appellant and counsel for the respondent agreed that the key period for
determining whether the Crown is liable in respect of the Minister’s conduct is
the period of that first application. (a)       The 1967 Application [100]                     
We will limit our review to a summary of the
initial correspondence between Mr. Hinse and the federal authorities. Mr. Hinse
sent his first application for mercy to the Minister on July 19, 1967. He
proclaimed his innocence and stated that he had identified the five people who
actually committed the crime. Three of them had agreed to sign affidavits,
which he had photocopied and enclosed with his application. The affidavits of Yvon Savard and Laurent Beausoleil were
identical, so we will reproduce only that of Mr. Savard: [translation] I, Yvon
Savard, hereby admit that I was one of the perpetrators of the armed robbery
committed on December 14, 1961 at the residence of Mr. and Mrs. Henriot
Grenier, of Mont-Laurier. Consequently, I
solicit the attention of the appropriate person so that I may be called to
testify in the case of Réjean Hinse and exonerate him of that crime, of which I
know, beyond a doubt, he is innocent. (A.R., vol.
VI, at p. 152) [101]                     
The affidavit of Claude Levasseur was different: [translation] I, Claude Levasseur, hereby
admit that I know the facts of what happened during the robbery committed
on December 14, 1961 at the residence of Mr. and Mrs. Henriot Grenier, of Mont-Laurier. Consequently, I
solicit the attention of the appropriate person so that I may be called to
testify in the case of Réjean Hinse and exonerate him of that crime, of which I
know, beyond a doubt, he is innocent. [Emphasis added.] (A.R., vol.
VI, at p. 155) [102]                     
Mr. Hinse had also identified the other two
perpetrators of the robbery: Georges Beaulieu and Léopold Véronneau. But he
explained that they had refused categorically to sign any statement whatsoever
and would refuse to testify even if they were offered court protection. [103]                     
J. A. Bélisle acknowledged receipt of the
application on behalf of the Director of the Criminal Law Section on July 28,
1967. That same day, Mr. Bélisle wrote to Quebec’s Deputy Minister of Justice,
asking the latter to send him the police reports. Mr. Hinse’s file then
remained inactive for more than a year after being sent to the Canadian
Penitentiary Service, which did not return it to the federal Department of
Justice. It was Mr. Hinse’s spouse who, by writing to the Minister in September
1968, caused the loss of the file to be discovered, and the file itself to be
reactivated. [104]                     
A series of letters were then exchanged, between
the office of the Deputy Solicitor General of Canada and the Criminal Law
Section of the Department of Justice in particular. In addition, the Quebec
government sent [translation] “certain
documentation” to the Minister in April 1969: A.R., vol. X, at p. 78. Mr. Bélisle
asked his Quebec counterpart about the possibility that they [translation] “compare [their] files at a
future date”: ibid., at p. 75. [105]                     
On March 12, 1971, Mr. Hinse applied to the
Governor General in Council for a free pardon under s. 655 Cr. C. (now
s. 748 Cr. C.), continuing to proclaim his innocence. On March 30 of
that same year, J. L. Cross of the Privy Council Office wrote to the Solicitor
General of Canada. He enclosed the conclusions of the Special Committee of the
Privy Council that had reviewed Mr. Hinse’s application for a pardon. The
following is an excerpt from those conclusions: It is our opinion that subject did not provide us with sufficient
fresh facts that were not available at the time of the trial and that could
have been a basis to prove his innocence under the royal prerogative of mercy. However, it is suggested that the case be referred to your
department for further study in this matter based on our above inquiry, and for
the Minister’s approval as to whether Mr. Hinse should be given a new trial. (A.R., vol.
X, at p. 83) [106]                     
In October 1971, Mr. Hinse obtained two
additional affidavits, one from Jean-Claude Pressé and the other from Laurent
Beausoleil. They are almost identical: [translation] I hereby declare that on or
about September 10, 1961, I was one of the passengers in the vehicle of Laurent
Beausoleil (a 1957 Buick) when said vehicle was searched and its passengers
were checked by officer Arthur Scott of the municipality of Mont-Laurier. I declare that,
besides me, there were: Laurent Beausoleil, Hugues Duval and Léopold Véronneau. I wish to attest
to the fact that neither Réjean Hinse nor André Lavoie was in the vehicle or
was with us on that day. (A.R., vol. X, at p. 85) [107]                     
Mr. Hinse sent these affidavits to the National
Parole Board, which forwarded them to the federal Minister of Justice in
November. On December 22, 1971, S. F. Sommerfeld, Director of the Criminal Law
Section, informed the National Parole Board of the Minister’s refusal in the
following words: [translation]  We have carefully reviewed
the file of Réjean Hinse and have come to the conclusion that a new trial
should not be granted in this matter. (A.R., vol. X, at p. 102) [108]                     
The National Parole Board forwarded this
response to Mr. Hinse on February 10, 1972. This response was not unrelated to
the result of Mr. Hinse’s parallel application for a free pardon. The Special
Committee of the Privy Council was of the opinion that there was not enough
fresh evidence to conclude that Mr. Hinse was innocent, but nevertheless
suggested that his case be submitted to the Minister. [109]                     
In our opinion, this documentary evidence
negates the trial judge’s inference that there had been no review whatsoever of
Mr. Hinse’s initial application for mercy. Although there are only a few
documents in the record, they nevertheless attest to the fact that a certain
review was conducted and that certain actions were taken in this regard. As the
Court of Appeal stated, given that the Minister was under no obligation to give
reasons for his decision at that time, it is inappropriate to draw a negative inference
from the summary nature of the Minister’s file in this matter. [110]                     
Moreover, the record contains minutes of hearing
that record an admission by the parties regarding the production of
determinative documents: [translation]  The parties admitted the following with regard to all the documents
in respect of which they make admissions for the purposes of production: -    they are certified copies of the originals; -    if the person who signed a document were to testify, he or she   would
confirm having written the document in question and having sent it to its
recipient, who received it, if such is the case; and -    finally, he or she would confirm that the document is proof of the
truth of its content. (Minutes from the hearing of November 9, 2010, A.R., vol. IV, at p. 57) [111]                     
One of the documents to which this admission
applied was a letter sent to Mrs. Hinse in January 1969 by Mr. Bélisle on
behalf of the Director of the Criminal Law Section in which Mr. Bélisle wrote: [translation]  Rest assured that we will
contact you [regarding your husband’s application] in the near future, as we
are currently conducting an extensive review of this case. [Emphasis
added.] (A.R., vol. X, at p. 62) [112]                     
Another document to which the admission applied
was a letter in which Mr. Sommerfeld, the Director of the Criminal Law Section,
forwarded the Minister’s refusal to the National Parole Board. In it, Mr. Sommerfeld
said the following: [translation] “We
have carefully reviewed the file of Réjean Hinse . . .” (A.R., vol. X, at p. 102).
By their admission, therefore, the parties had acknowledged that if Mr. Bélisle
and Mr. Sommerfeld were to testify, they would have confirmed that these
letters were proof of the truth of their content — in short, that as Mr. Bélisle
and Mr. Sommerfeld had understood the facts, an extensive and careful review of
Mr. Hinse’s case was under way at the time in question. The trial judge did not
mention this admission. It is true that the obligation to give reasons for
judgments does not imply that a judge must address every little detail of a
case. However, given the state of the documentary evidence in the record, the
trial judge should have considered this admission before inferring that no
review had been conducted. Taken together with the other relevant evidence that
we have just discussed, it did not support her inference that a review had not
been undertaken. [113]                     
The probative value of this admission is
enhanced by the fact that the appellant, for reasons known only to him, asked
merely to examine a single representative of the AGC and did not specifically
summon the decision makers who had played a role in the review of his
applications for mercy: R.R., vol. I, at p. 16. Moreover, when the appellant
began his action, he concentrated his efforts on the suit against the AGQ and
Mont-Laurier, no doubt because it was they who were primarily responsible for
the damage he had suffered. [114]                     
If we disregard the inferences drawn from the
presumptions of fact on which Mr. Hinse relies, we must find that, on a balance
of probabilities, the evidence does not support his assertion that the Minister
failed to conduct a meaningful review of his initial application. The appellant
has also failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the Minister
acted in bad faith or with serious recklessness in reviewing his application.
Although he points to the fact that the Minister misplaced his file for a
period of time, this fact cannot be equated with bad faith or serious
recklessness. The review of the application stretched over several years from
the time it was received until the time the Minister gave his final answer.
Despite the delay at issue, an analysis of the circumstances does not support
the conclusion that the Minister acted in bad faith or with serious
recklessness. Here again, the burden of proof was on Mr. Hinse. We cannot find
that he discharged it. (b)      The Other Applications [115]                     
The appellant submitted a second application for
mercy on July 23, 1980. This application was only three paragraphs long. On December 30 of that same year, a special adviser to the
Minister informed Mr. Hinse that his application had been denied because it
contained only [translation] “vague
allegations of mistaken identification that occurred during [his] trial”, and
because after reading Judge Omer Côté’s judgment, the Department had “found nothing to support [his]
affirmation”: A.R., vol. X, at p. 108. [116]                     
A week later, on January 6, 1981, Mr. Hinse
submitted a third application to the Minister. On January 22, the special
adviser to the Minister asked him to set out in writing, and in detail, the
grounds that he intended to raise in support of his application for mercy, as
well as all the contacts he had had with other judicial and political
authorities. The adviser stated that [translation]
“it is essential that you disclose the new facts that lead you to
request an interview with the Minister”: A.R., vol. X, at p. 111. Mr. Hinse
sent the Minister a more detailed letter on March 9, 1981. [117]                     
As the Court of Appeal observed, most of the
facts Mr. Hinse alleged in that letter were the same as the ones that had been
set out in his 1967 application, the exception being allegations with respect
to an identification error made by officer Scott and to the conduct of counsel
and of the judge at his trial. First, Mr. Hinse claimed that Mr. Véronneau —
with whom he had been jointly tried — had retained a criminal lawyer [translation] “who had close ties to
Judge Omer Côté” and who had previously defended Mr. Beaulieu, Mr. Levasseur
and Mr. Savard in another case: A.R., vol. XI, at p. 10. This lawyer allegedly
recommended to these three individuals that they not testify for the defence,
and this enabled him to have Mr. Véronneau acquitted. Next, Mr. Hinse explained
that officer Scott had had an excellent lead from the outset. Upon arriving at
the scene of the crime, he had made a connection with a search he had
undertaken two months earlier when he had stopped four suspicious individuals
in a car with its lights turned off at about 10:00 p.m. in front of the
victims’ house. Those four individuals were Mr. Beausoleil, Mr. Véronneau, Mr. Duval
and Mr. Pressé. According to Mr. Hinse, Mr. Beausoleil and Mr. Duval had
confided to him that officer Scott had also taken down the name of André
Lavoie, since the vehicle was registered in his name. Mr. Hinse said that at
the trial, officer Scott had referred to his notes from that initial arrest and
that he had been “shocked” to hear the officer testify that he had been the
fifth occupant of the car even though his name did not appear in the officer’s
notebook: ibid., at p. 11. [118]                     
On September 23, 1981, the special adviser
responded to Mr. Hinse as follows:                     [translation]  I regret to inform you
that, despite the additional explanations you gave to the Minister, your case
is not one that justifies his intervention. Indeed, the Minister of Justice
exercises his power of intervention in exceptional circumstances only, and no
such circumstances were revealed in the thorough examination of your file. (A.R., vol. XI, at p. 16) [119]                     
Finally, several years later, the appellant
retained a lawyer who, in November 1990, sent a fourth application for mercy to
the Minister of the day. The
lawyer explained that the Commission de police had
conducted an investigation and prepared a report, which he enclosed with his
letter. In reply, the Minister acknowledged that the report [translation] “describes fresh evidence
highly deserving of consideration”: A.R., vol. XI, at p. 75. However, she
expressed the opinion that the issues raised by the Commission de police could
also be heard by the Quebec Court of Appeal without this task having to be
imposed on it under s. 690 Cr.
C. The Minister invited Mr. Hinse’s lawyer to contact
her again should the Court of Appeal refuse to consider his case. [120]                     
As in the case of the
first application for mercy, we find that none of the Ministers who considered
the three subsequent applications acted in bad faith or with serious
recklessness. Mr. Hinse cannot reasonably argue that the Minister failed to
conduct a meaningful review in respect of any of those applications. The
relevant correspondence shows the opposite to be true. Nor has the requisite
element of bad faith or serious recklessness been proven. Regarding Mr. Hinse’s
second application (1980), which was very brief and contained no new evidence
or legal arguments, it was open to the Minister to find it frivolous and to
reject it on that basis. As for the third application, as the Court of Appeal
wrote, [translation] “[g]iven that Mr. Hinse did not go into much detail, the new
allegations, based on vague irregularities committed by the police officers,
attorneys and trial judge, could have struck the Minister as being of little
consequence”: para. 181. In the case of the fourth application (1990), the Minister justified her
decision by noting that the Court of Appeal could agree on its own to consider
the case without her having to intervene. This was a reasonable attitude to
adopt, particularly since the Minister did not reject Mr. Hinse’s application
outright, but asked him to contact her again should the Court of Appeal refuse
to consider his case. It should be noted that an application for mercy is an
exceptional remedy that is available only after the applicant’s legal rights have
been exhausted: Thatcher, at para. 9. [121]                     
In short, after a
proper analysis of the Ministers’ conduct based on the duty they owed and the
applicable standard of fault, we cannot conclude that Mr. Hinse has discharged
his burden, namely that of proving that the Ministers acted in bad faith or
with serious recklessness in dealing with his applications for mercy. Our
analysis could end with this finding, but like the Court of Appeal, we believe
that some comments on causation and damages are in order. C.       Causation [122]                     
The trial judge concluded that Mr. Hinse had
proven causation, once again by means of presumptions of fact. In her view, [translation] “[a] sustained, concerted,
extensive, competent and timely review of his initial efforts would surely have
brought the errors to the AGC’s attention”: para. 75. Her finding on causation
was based primarily on the 1990 report of the Commission de police: because the
Commission de police had concluded that a miscarriage of justice had occurred,
a meaningful review by the Minister should logically have led to the same
result. In light of the nine years that had elapsed between the time when Mr. Hinse
contacted the Commission de police (1988) and the date of his acquittal by this
Court (1997), the trial judge found that Mr. Hinse could have been acquitted in
the mid-1970s were it not for the AGC’s fault: paras. 77 and 97. [123]                     
We agree with the Court of Appeal that, even if
it were assumed that the Minister failed to conduct a meaningful review between
1967 and 1972, it was not possible to conclude that such a review would
inevitably have led to the discovery of the irregularities brought to light in
1990 by the report of the Commission de police. A comparison of the information
in that report with the information that was available when Mr. Hinse made his
initial application to the Minister reveals two crucial pieces of evidence that
could not, in all likelihood, have been discovered at that time. [124]                     
According to the evidence in the record, it was
not until November 1988, when Mr. Hinse wrote to the Commission de police, that
he provided [translation] “for the
first time certain crucial details that would guide the work of Commissioner
Fourcaudot”: C.A. decision, at para. 65. The report of the Commission de police
shows that the most significant facts that emerged from the investigation were
officer Scott’s recantation of his testimony and, to a lesser degree, the
willingness of the true perpetrators of the crime to co-operate with the
investigator in 1989 and 1990. [125]                     
Where the perpetrators of the crime are
concerned, it should be noted that after they had signed their affidavits in
1966, Mr. Beausoleil, Mr. Savard and Mr. Levasseur refused to co-operate
further with the police. In the second set of affidavits signed in 1971, Mr. Pressé
and Mr. Beausoleil merely attested to their having been in the car that was
searched by officer Scott in Mont-Laurier on September 10, 1961, and to the
fact that Mr. Lavoie and Mr. Hinse had not been in it. They made no
declarations about the robbery committed in December of that same year of which
Mr. Hinse had been found guilty. At the time of the investigation carried out
by Mr. Fourcaudot in 1989, Mr. Beausoleil added [translation] “many details” about the events, and Mr. Véronneau,
although he had refused to sign an affidavit, ended up stating that Mr. Hinse [translation] “wasn’t even there”: A.R.,
vol. XI, at pp. 54 and 53. [126]                     
Even more importantly, the investigator received
a call from Mr. Duval, who was then living in the Dominican Republic, in 1990.
Mr. Duval revealed for the first time several details regarding the conspiracy
and the robbery, stating that Mr. Hinse was in no way involved. He subsequently
sent the investigator a letter confirming this information. However, the police
report of September 12, 1966, prepared by an officer named Bourgeois (officer
in charge of the Sûreté du Québec detachment at Mont-Laurier), indicated that
Mr. Duval had provided the police with information about the robbery and that
he was supposed to be questioned further. Mr. Duval was never questioned after
that. [127]                     
This “oversight” can perhaps be explained by a
comment made by Mr. Duval in his conversation with the investigator in 1990
that he knew officer Bourgeois quite well at the time, as the latter had taken
part in some chain letter schemes he was operating. This is why Mr. Duval [translation] “was never bothered by the
police, even though he believed that they knew he was behind the robbery”:
A.R., vol. XI, at p. 56. Officer Bourgeois had played an important role in the
initial investigation, particularly in the identification of Mr. Hinse by the
victims of the robbery. [128]                     
Nevertheless, the evidence does not support an
assertion that Mr. Duval would have been prepared to incriminate himself in
this way or to co-operate with the police (or the Minister) at the time of the
initial police investigation, or at the time of Mr. Hinse’s first application
for mercy. This information was in fact highly incriminating. As the AGC points
out, these statements were ultimately made from the Dominican Republic, a
country with which Canada does not have an extradition treaty. [129]                     
Moreover, the particular focus of the report of
the Commission de police is on officer Scott’s recantation of his testimony.
This is clear from both the language used and the number of pages dedicated to
this subject. Out of the report’s 35 pages, the role of officer Scott takes up
approximately 9, whereas the analysis of each of the other exculpatory factors
rarely exceeds 2 pages. The officer’s testimony had [translation] “made a strong impression” on the trial judge,
because he had declared under oath, without any hesitation, that he had seen
Mr. Hinse among the individuals in the car he had stopped on September 10,
1961: A.R., vol. XI, at p. 56. This declaration contradicted Mr. Hinse’s
version of the facts. The officer testified that he had known Mr. Hinse for a
long time and swore categorically that Mr. Hinse had been in Mont-Laurier that
day. It was not until his third meeting with the investigator of the Commission
de police, on July 31, 1990, that officer Scott admitted he might have been
mistaken. [130]                     
It should be mentioned that officer Scott had
difficulty identifying the exact year in which he had started having doubts
about his testimony. He said it may have been around 1974 or 1975, after a
friend of Mr. Duval’s (Yves Chalifoux) and Mr. Duval himself both told him he
was wrong. It was these conversations that in all likelihood sowed a doubt in
his mind, and that doubt finally surfaced during the investigation of the
Commission de police. On this point, too, it cannot be assumed that officer
Scott would have recanted his testimony earlier. [131]                     
As a result, even if the Minister had decided to
conduct a more extensive investigation at the time of Mr. Hinse’s first
application, there is no evidence that officer Scott would have recanted his
testimony then, as he did later, or that the individuals involved in the
robbery would have been inclined to answer the Minister’s questions. It is
highly likely that, 20 years after the events, these individuals agreed to co-operate
with the authorities because they had less to fear, or because they no longer
had anything to lose. [132]                     
Also, Poulin J.’s assertion that the Minister’s
investigation should [translation] “surely”
have led to the same result as the report of the Commission de police is based
on assumptions and inferences that are not supported by any analysis. It is
well established that, even where a fault has been committed, the person who
committed it cannot be held liable for damage that was not related to the
fault. Rather, the damage must have been a logical, direct and immediate
consequence of the fault (art. 1053 C.C.L.C.; Parrot v. Thompson,
[1984] 1 S.C.R. 57, at p. 71; Dallaire v. Paul-Émile Martel Inc., [1989]
2 S.C.R. 419; Baudouin, Deslauriers and Moore, at No. 1-683). [133]                     
Furthermore, as the Commission de police
explained in a letter to Mr. Hinse, it [translation]
“may, at the written request of a citizen, investigate the conduct of
municipal police or Sûreté du Québec officers if the citizen provides
sufficient grounds for his or her request”: A.R., vol. XI, at p. 23. In the
case at bar, the Commission de police instructed an investigator to conduct an
investigation in accordance with the Act respecting police organization,
R.S.Q., c. O-8.1, ss. 64 to 88 (later replaced by the Police Act, CQLR,
c. P-13.1 (S.Q. 2000, c. 12, s. 353)). Under that Act, the investigator had the
power to enter any police station and examine any documents or other effects
relating to the complaint. He could also require of any person any information
or document he considered necessary. Moreover, all persons were prohibited from
hindering his work in any manner whatever, deceiving him through concealment or
by making a false declaration, refusing to furnish him with information or a
document relating to the complaint, refusing to allow him to make a copy of
such a document, or concealing or destroying such a document: ss. 71, 84 and 85
of the Act respecting police organization. [134]                     
In this case, the report of the Commission de
police indicates that the investigator                     [translation] [f]or several months . . .
focused his efforts on building up a huge file: he met with numerous
individuals and collected their stories; he searched through the records of
several courthouses and examined all the documents he could lay his hands on;
and, finally, he reported his findings to the Commission. (A.R., vol. XI, at p. 35) [135]                     
However, it is clear that the Minister did not
have those same powers at the material times. It was not until 2002 that the
Minister was given the powers of a commissioner under the Inquiries Act ,
including the power to summon witnesses and to compel them to testify and to
produce documents: s. 696.2(2)  Cr. C.; ss. 4 and 5  of the Inquiries
Act . These new powers were deemed necessary because of the inefficiency of
the existing review process: House of Commons Debates, vol. 137, No. 054,
1st Sess., 37th Parl., May 3, 2001, at p. 3583; Debates of the Senate,
vol. 139, No. 66, 1st Sess., 37th Parl., November 1, 2001, at p. 1612. [136]                     
A distinction must therefore be made between the
investigation conducted by the Commission de police from 1988 to 1990 and the
meaningful review of an application for mercy that the Minister was required to
conduct in the late 1960s. At that time, the Minister had neither the power nor
the duty to compel witnesses to testify, to require the production of
documents, or to review police or prosecution files, which would have enabled
him or her to build up a file as extensive and exhaustive as the one amassed by
the Commission de police. On this point, we cannot accept Mr. Hinse’s argument
that officer Scott might have retracted his testimony sooner had the Minister
confronted him with certain evidence that discredited it. The Minister was not
required to take such action; he was simply required to consider Mr. Hinse’s
application in good faith and to determine on the basis of the file submitted
to him whether additional information was needed or intervention was
appropriate. The evidence does not establish that at the time of the first
application, the Minister would probably have discovered the key evidence
uncovered by the investigator of the Commission de police 20 years later. The
burden of proving that the Minister would probably have done so was on Mr. Hinse,
and it was up to him to discharge this burden. [137]                     
In this regard, Poulin J. did not really explain
her reasoning on the issue of causation, but merely stated that the facts set
out in her reasons, which Mr. Hinse had proven by means of presumptions of
fact, established a causal connection: para. 98. However, it is clear from her
reasons that her finding that the miscarriage of justice would have been
ascertained quickly if the AGC had acted promptly and competently (para. 97) is
based on the erroneous premise that the Minister, like the investigator of the
Commission de police, had a duty to conduct a thorough investigation. Because
Poulin J., in so doing, drew inferences and made findings of fact that were not
supported by the evidence, the Court of Appeal was justified in intervening: Housen
v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at para. 22; H.L. v.
Canada (Attorney General), 2005 SCC 25, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401, at para. 4. It
has therefore not been proven that the alleged failure, namely the failure to
conduct a meaningful review or to conduct one more expeditiously, was the
probable cause of the failure to discover the miscarriage of justice in Mr. Hinse’s
case. To conclude otherwise would be to rely on mere conjecture or remote
hypotheticals. A court’s conclusion with respect to civil liability cannot be
based on speculation such as this. D.       Damages [138]                     
In our opinion, the Court of Appeal was also
right to intervene on the issue of damages. There was an overriding error in
the trial judge’s analysis. She failed to take into account the requirement
that the liability be apportioned solidarily, and to establish the amounts
being awarded on the basis of the actual liability of each of the solidary
debtors. As the Court of Appeal noted, [translation]
“to every extent that more than one solidary debtor could be liable for
the heads of claim, Mr. Hinse’s releases made it necessary to examine the
causal faults and apportion liability”: para. 189. Mr. Hinse should have borne
the shares of the solidary debtors he had released: arts. 1526 and 1690 C.C.Q. [139]                     
The trial judge addressed the issue of damages
as if the Minister were the only party to commit a fault and as if the damage
sustained by Mr. Hinse was due solely to the Minister’s [translation] “institutional inertia”:
paras. 75-77. Indeed, rather than fixing the damages amounts that could be
specifically attributed to the AGC, she simply relied on Mr. Hinse’s claims: [translation] Furthermore, since,
following the transaction entered into between the AGQ and Hinse, the latter
amended his proceeding so as to claim from the AGC only the portion he had
attributed to [the AGC] on the basis of the various heads of damage he raised,
the Court will examine, for the purpose of this proceeding and in compliance
with the provisions quoted above, only the applications that are in line with
this new reality and that concern solely the AGC. [para. 22] [140]                     
Thus, except in the case of the punitive
damages, the trial judge awarded the amounts being claimed on the assumption
that Mr. Hinse had correctly limited them to the amounts that solely concerned
the AGC. However, the apportionment of the liability of Mr. Hinse’s various co-debtors
had to be determined on the basis of the seriousness of each one’s fault: art. 1478
C.C.Q. The trial judge could not simply rely on the apportionment
suggested by Mr. Hinse; her role as the arbiter of damages required that she
herself fix each debtor’s share of the liability. [141]                     
In addition to this overriding error, which
skews the amounts awarded under all the heads of damages, the grounds for each
of those amounts were also flawed. (1)      Pecuniary Damage [142]                     
Poulin J. ordered the AGC to pay a total of $855,229.61
in respect of pecuniary damage. This amount seems excessive, given that the AGQ
had already paid $1,100,000 under this head pursuant to the transaction entered
into with Mr. Hinse. At the very least, the onus was on Mr. Hinse to show that
the payments concerned distinct heads of compensation. He did not do so.
Moreover, when the amounts awarded are broken down, it is clear that there was
no justification for the amounts being claimed. [143]                     
The amount of $127,214 awarded for a loss of
income by Mr. Hinse that resulted from his retiring at age 60 instead of at 65
is unjustified. In Quebec law, only an injury which is an immediate and direct
consequence of a wrongful act gives rise to an entitlement to damages: art. 1607
C.C.Q. This was a personal decision on Mr. Hinse’s part. There is no
direct connection between the Ministers’ conduct and his decision. Poulin J.
erred in awarding damages under this head of claim. [144]                     
Poulin J. ordered the AGC to pay Mr. Hinse
$193,660.88 under the head of claim for fees and costs incurred in respect of
the proceedings he brought in the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court between
1990 and 1997. She was wrong to do so. Even if the Minister had granted one of
Mr. Hinse’s applications, he would have either ordered a new trial or referred
the matter to the Court of Appeal. In short, Mr. Hinse would have had to pay
these fees anyway. This is not damage that resulted from the alleged faults. [145]                     
Poulin J. awarded $500,000 for investigation
costs, wasted time and effort, photocopies, transcripts, travel, postage, etc.
The Court of Appeal correctly found that wasted time and efforts expended to
obtain justice are inconveniences that are inherent in the efforts of anyone
who is involved in legal proceedings: para. 215. Unless there has been an abuse
of process, these are not heads of damage under which Mr. Hinse can seek
compensation. Moreover, they fall under non-pecuniary damage, given that there
is no evidence of lost income. Since Poulin J. awarded a separate amount in
respect of non-pecuniary damage, this resulted in double recovery. (2)      Non-pecuniary Damage [146]                     
In the Andrews trilogy, this Court set an
upper limit of $100,000 for non-pecuniary losses resulting from a serious
bodily injury: Andrews v. Grand & Toy Alberta Ltd., [1978] 2 S.C.R.
229; Thornton v. School District No. 57 (Prince George), [1978] 2 S.C.R.
267; Arnold v. Teno, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 287. This limit applies in the
common law provinces and Quebec alike. Relying on its own decision in France
Animation, the Court of Appeal applied the limit in the instant case. But
when it rendered its decision, the Court of Appeal did not have the benefit of
this Court’s judgment in Cinar, which confirmed that the limit is
inapplicable to damages for non-pecuniary loss that do not stem from bodily
injury: Cinar Corporation v. Robinson, 2013 SCC 73, [2013] 3 S.C.R.
1168, at para. 97. This being said, even if the Court of Appeal erred on this
point, the trial judge had nonetheless erred in awarding an amount under this
head of damages. [147]                     
Poulin J., after comparing the amount —
$1,900,000 — claimed by Mr. Hinse for non-pecuniary damage with the amounts
granted in the Marshall, Proulx, Sophonow, Milgaard and Truscott
cases, ordered the AGC to pay him the exact amount he sought,
expressing the opinion that it was [translation]
“not excessive”: para. 198. In Cinar, this Court reiterated that
to properly assess the amounts to be awarded, a court should compare the case
at hand with other analogous cases in which amounts were awarded for non-pecuniary
damage: paras. 105-6. In the case at bar, the comparisons made were shaky and
did not justify a quantum of that magnitude. [148]                     
In the case of Donald Marshall Jr., a royal
commission was struck to review the case in 1989. In his report submitted in
1990, Justice Evans valued the amount to compensate for non-pecuniary losses at
$225,000, to which were added $158,000 in interest, for a total of $383,000 in
compensation. Mr. Marshall, who had been convicted of murder in 1971, had spent
11 years in prison (between the ages of 17 and 28) and had been acquitted in
1983: G. T. Evans, Commission of Inquiry Concerning the Adequacy of
Compensation Paid to Donald Marshall, Jr., Report of the Commissioner
(1990); In the Matter of Steven Truscott, at p. 48; C.A. decision, at
paras. 221-22; Sup. Ct. decision, at para. 184. [149]                     
In the Proulx case, Mr. Proulx had been
convicted of murder on November 10, 1991, and was acquitted on August 20, 1992:
Proulx v. Québec (Procureur général), [1997] R.J.Q. 2509 (Sup. Ct.). He
sued the AGQ for $1,443,000 in damages. In 1997, Letarte J. awarded him
$250,000 in compensation for non-pecuniary damage: [1997] R.J.Q. 2516 (Sup. Ct.),
at p. 2524. [150]                     
In the inquiry regarding Thomas Sophonow, the
Honourable Peter Cory recommended in 2001 the payment in compensation of
approximately $2,600,000, including interest, of which $1,750,000 would be for
non-pecuniary damage. Mr. Sophonow had undergone three trials and spent nearly
four years in prison after being unjustly charged with murder. The liability
for payment of the compensation was to be apportioned among the city
(Winnipeg), the province (Manitoba) and the federal government: P. deC. Cory, The
Inquiry Regarding Thomas Sophonow: The Investigation, Prosecution and
Consideration of Entitlement to Compensation (2001); C.A. decision, at
para. 222; Sup. Ct. decision, at para. 184. [151]                     
In the Milgaard case, a total of $10,000,000 was
paid to Mr. Milgaard in 2008 following the settlement of two civil liability
suits. The exact apportionment of liability among the levels of government is
unknown. Mr. Milgaard had been charged with murder in 1970 and had spent 23 years
in prison. He had been shot during one of two escape attempts and had suffered
abuse while incarcerated: In the Matter of Steven Truscott, at p.
49. [152]                     
Finally, in the Truscott case, Justice
Robins recommended in 2008 that a payment of $6,500,000 be made to Mr. Truscott,
who had been convicted of murder at the age of 14 and sentenced to death by
hanging. Mr. Truscott, who was the subject of an unprecedented reference to
this Court, had spent 10 years in prison and had finally been on parole for
almost 40 years, living under an assumed name. Justice Robins felt that, in the
circumstances, Mr. Truscott should be paid $250,000 per year of incarceration
and $100,000 per year on parole. Given that both levels of government had been
involved in the case virtually from the beginning, Justice Robins was of the
opinion that they should share the costs of the compensation equally: In the
Matter of Steven Truscott, at p. 56. [153]                     
As the Court of Appeal pointed out, the amounts
granted in the Marshall, Sophonow and Truscott cases were made further to the
recommendations of advisory bodies. They did not result from judicial awards
and were based on considerations that are very different from those on which
damages are based: C.A. decision, at para. 222. Only the compensation assessed
in Proulx was the result of a judicial process. What is more, all these
cases can be distinguished from the case at bar in that they involved the much
more serious crime of murder and in that the period of incarceration was longer
in almost all of them. [154]                     
Moreover, we note that under the transaction
between the AGQ and Mr. Hinse, the latter was paid only $1,100,000 under this
head of damages, whereas he had been claiming $3,000,000 in this regard from
the AGQ and the AGC, for which they were to be solidarily liable. We realize
that care must be taken in comparing amounts agreed to in transactions with
amounts resulting from judicial awards. Nevertheless, in this case, Mr. Hinse
and the AGQ fixed the amount under this head of damages in their agreement
after each side had made its case. In the circumstances of this case, we have
difficulty seeing why the federal government should be ordered to pay more in
respect of non-pecuniary damage than the amount paid by the province. Even if
the Minister had committed a fault, we find it hard to justify finding that
such a fault would be as serious as, or even more serious than, the ones
committed by Mont-Laurier and the AGQ with regard to the arrest, the police
investigation and the criminal prosecution that led to Mr. Hinse’s wrongful
conviction and imprisonment. At the very most, such a fault would have
prolonged the damage already caused by the town and the AGQ. [155]                     
In our opinion, therefore, an order that the AGC
pay $1,900,000 after the AGQ had paid $1,100,000 under the same head of damages
would be disproportionate. In a civil liability case, the court’s primary
objective is to compensate the plaintiff for damage he or she has suffered, not
to punish the debtor. (3)      Punitive Damages (a)      
Reference in the C.L.P.A. to Provincial Law [156]                     
Poulin J. ordered the AGC to pay Mr. Hinse
$2,500,000 in punitive damages under s. 49 of the Charter of human rights
and freedoms, CQLR, c. C-12 (“Charter”). Section 3  C.L.P.A. 
provides that the federal Crown is liable for damages for which, if it were a
person, it would be liable for the purpose of assessing damage caused by the
fault of a servant of the Crown. According to s. 2  C.L.P.A. , “liability”
means “extracontractual civil liability” in the Quebec context. It must
therefore be determined whether this reference in the C.L.P.A. 
encompasses the remedy of punitive damages provided for in the Charter.
This question does not appear to have been answered by the courts. We are of
the opinion that it must be answered in the affirmative. [157]                     
First, when Parliament enacted the Crown
Liability Act, the predecessor to the C.L.P.A. , in 1953, the
intention was “to make the federal crown liable to the full extent to which a
person in a private capacity would be liable under the provincial law”: House
of Commons Debates, vol. IV, 7th Sess., 21st Parl., March 26, 1953, at p. 3330;
see also s. 3(1) of the Crown Liability Act. Under the C.L.P.A. ,
the Crown continues to be liable for damages for which, if it were a person, it
would be liable in respect of damage caused by the fault of a servant of the
Crown, the word “person” meaning a natural person of full age and capacity: ss.
3  and 2.1 . [158]                     
Second, as can be seen from the language used in
the C.L.P.A.  and from its bijural nature, Parliament has referred to the
applicable provincial law in very general terms: extracontractual civil
liability in Quebec and liability in tort in any other province. Even before
1953, this Court [translation] “had
already held that the suppletive law in delict and in tort is the law of the
place where the right of action arose”: P. Garant, with the collaboration of P.
Garant and J. Garant, Droit administratif (6th ed. 2010), at p. 913. The
applicable provincial law to which the C.L.P.A.  refers includes not only
the relevant articles of the C.C.Q., but also all the provincial
statutes that modify the liability law of the province where the cause of
action arose, including the Charter: see s. 8.1  of the Interpretation
Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21 ; Hogg, Monahan and Wright, at p. 436. [159]                     
Third, although it is true that there is a
“purist” view according to which the concept of punitive damages does not exist
in the traditional civil law (see, e.g., Chaput v. Romain, [1955] S.C.R.
834, at p. 841; Baudouin, Deslauriers and Moore, at No. 1-373), the awarding of
such damages has been permitted in Quebec civil law in certain circumstances
for many years: see, e.g., the Tree Protection Act, CQLR, c. P-37. In
addition, at the time of the reform of the C.C.Q., the draft Civil
Code of Québec provided that punitive damages could be widely awarded in
cases involving gross or intentional fault: Baudouin, Deslauriers and Moore, at
No. 1-373. Although the legislature ultimately abandoned this idea, punitive
damages are now referred to in art. 1621 C.C.Q., but they remain an exceptional
remedy given that they can be awarded only where they are expressly provided
for by law: de Montigny v. Brossard (Succession), 2010 SCC 51, [2010] 3
S.C.R. 64, at para. 48; Béliveau St-Jacques v.
Fédération des employées et employés de services publics inc., [1996] 2
S.C.R. 345, at para. 20. [160]                     
In our opinion, the scheme established by the Charter
in this regard can be seen as complementing the rules of extracontractual
liability. The Charter [translation]
“has the effect of complementing the protection afforded by the Civil
Code by creating a new remedy that enables victims to claim punitive damages
that are not available under the [Civil] Code”: L. Perret, “De l’impact de la
Charte des droits et libertés de la personne sur le droit civil des contrats et
de la responsabilité au Québec” (1981), 12 R.G.D. 121, at p. 170. [161]                     
Thus, the scheme of punitive damages provided
for in s. 49 of the Charter is not distinct from and inconsistent with
the rules of extracontractual civil liability. Rather, they contribute to this
area of the law without being totally subsumed by it. The two sets of rules
intersect at several levels, but the remedy under s. 49 is not entirely
subordinate to the conditions for civil liability. It can constitute an
autonomous scheme that creates remedies that are not based in civil liability: de
Montigny, at para. 44; Cinar, at para. 124; Quebec
(Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) v.
Communauté urbaine de Montréal, 2004 SCC 30, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 789, at para. 26. [162]                     
Before the Charter came into force in
1976, fundamental rights were protected by the civil liability provisions of
the C.C.L.C. And [translation] “the
civil law concept of fault is an extremely flexible one that affords protection
to individuals in all spheres”: Perret, at p. 124; L. LeBel, “La protection des
droits fondamentaux et la responsabilité civile” (2004), 49 McGill L.J. 231,
at p. 235. In the instant case, the alleged wrongful conduct essentially
occurred before the C.C.Q. came into force. The preliminary provision of
the C.C.Q. now expressly provides that the C.C.Q., “in
harmony with the Charter . . . and the general principles of law, governs
persons, relations between persons, and property”. The C.C.L.C. lacked
equivalents for both the preliminary provision and art. 1621 of the C.C.Q.,
but we are nevertheless of the opinion that this does not affect our
analysis. Although these provisions attest to the relationship between the Charter
and the C.C.Q., they do not create that relationship and are
therefore not essential to our conclusion. [163]                     
For these reasons, we conclude that the
reference in the C.L.P.A.  to provincial law encompasses the remedy of
punitive damages provided for in the Charter. We would add that since
punitive damages are also available in the law of the common law provinces,
this conclusion favours a more uniform application of the law of Crown
liability across the country. Having resolved this preliminary issue, we will
now consider whether it was appropriate to award such damages in this case. (b)        
Award of Punitive Damages [164]                     
Section 49 of the Charter provides that,
“[i]n case of unlawful and intentional interference, the tribunal may, in
addition, condemn the person guilty of it to punitive damages.” This Court
explained what “unlawful and intentional interference” means in Quebec
(Public Curator) v. Syndicat national des employés de l’hôpital St-Ferdinand,
[1996] 3 S.C.R. 211: Consequently,
there will be unlawful and intentional interference within the meaning of the
second paragraph of s. 49 of the Charter when the person who commits the
unlawful interference has a state of mind that implies a desire or intent to
cause the consequences of his or her wrongful conduct, or when that person acts
with full knowledge of the immediate and natural or at least extremely probable
consequences that his or her conduct will cause. This test is not as strict
as specific intent, but it does go beyond simple negligence. Thus, an
individual’s recklessness, however wild and foolhardy, as to the consequences
of his or her wrongful acts will not in itself satisfy this test. [Emphasis
added; para. 121.] [165]                     
In the instant case, given that the Ministers’
conduct cannot be equated with bad faith or serious recklessness, we cannot
conclude that there was intentional interference. The evidence does not support
a finding that the Ministers’ state of mind was such that they intended to harm
Mr. Hinse or had knowledge of the adverse consequences their conduct would have
for him. This stringent test was not met, and punitive damages should not have
been awarded. (4)      Extrajudicial Fees [166]                     
Finally, the trial judge concluded that the
AGC’s conduct had amounted to an abuse of process, and she ordered the AGC to
pay Mr. Hinse $100,000 for the fees paid to the first law firm he had retained:
para. 230. She also awarded $440,000 for services rendered by the firm that had
replaced the first and with which Mr. Hinse had entered into a pro bono
agreement: para. 240. To justify her decision to award this amount even though
Mr. Hinse had not had to pay his lawyers, the trial judge relied on an Ontario
judgment: para. 236, quoting 1465778 Ontario Inc. v. 1122077 Ontario Ltd. (2006), 82 O.R. (3d) 757
(C.A.). She was of the opinion that it would be
[translation] “unfair for a person
at fault to have the benefit of an agreement [concluded] for the purpose of
helping out a victim”: para. 239.
However, she stated that in order to avoid unjust enrichment, such an award
could be made only if there was an agreement under which the party was to remit
the amount to his or her counsel: paras. 237-39. It should be pointed out that
the total amount of the transaction with the AGQ — $5.3 million — had included $800,000
for Mr. Hinse’s lawyers. [167]                     
The Court of Appeal reversed the trial judge’s
conclusion, finding that the AGC was entitled to answer the case against him
given the amounts being claimed and the legal principles at issue. It found
that the AGC had not shown bad faith in defending himself and that he had not
taken multiple procedural steps or unnecessarily and improperly continued the
proceedings. The Court of Appeal also cautioned against [translation] “[indiscriminately]
importing common law precedents” and stated that “[t]he judge wrongly referred
to a case from Ontario case law to grant the claim, extrajudicial fees being
different from costs”: paras. 243-44. [168]                     
In Viel v. Entreprises Immobilières du
Terroir ltée, [2002] R.J.Q. 1262, the Court of Appeal
had confirmed that in Quebec law, it is only in exceptional cases that a party
can be required to pay the fees of lawyers retained by the opposing party. Such
compensation must be consistent with the general rules of civil liability: paras.
72-73. There must be a fault committed by the other party, damage, and a causal
connection between the fault and the damage. In Viel, the Court of
Appeal mentioned the distinction between an abuse on the merits and an abuse of
process, and noted that only an abuse of process can justify awarding
extrajudicial fees as damages:                     [translation] 
In theory, and save exceptional circumstances, the fees paid by one
party to its attorney cannot, in my opinion, be considered direct damages that
sanction abuse on the merits. There is no adequate causation between the
fault (abuse on the merits) and the damage. Adequate causation corresponds to
the event or events having a logical, direct and immediate relation with the
origin of the injury suffered. . . . . . . Conversely,
regardless of whether there is abuse on the merits, a party [whose conduct
amounts to an abuse of process] causes injury to the opposing party, which, to
combat the abuse, needlessly pays judicial fees to its attorney. In that
event, there is an actual causation between the fault and the damage. [Emphasis
added; emphasis in original deleted.] (Viel,
at paras. 77-79) [169]                     
Since Viel, the Quebec legislature has
added provisions to the Code of Civil Procedure, CQLR, c. C-25 (“C.C.P.”),
that confirm the power of the courts to impose sanctions for improper use of
procedure: see arts. 54.1 to 54.6. Article 54.4 C.C.P. provides that a
court may, inter alia, “condemn a party to pay, in addition to costs,
damages in reparation for the prejudice suffered by another party, including
the fees and extrajudicial costs incurred by that party”. [170]                     
Thus, in Quebec, damages can be awarded in
respect of extrajudicial fees in cases of abuse of process in order to
compensate a party who has suffered damage resulting from the fault of the
other party. In the common law provinces, costs are traditionally awarded to
indemnify the successful party for expenses incurred either in defending an
unfounded claim (if the successful party is the defendant) or in pursuing a
valid legal right (if the plaintiff prevails): see, e.g., British Columbia
(Minister of Forests) v. Okanagan Indian Band, 2003 SCC 71, [2003] 3 S.C.R.
371, at para. 21; Young v. Young, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 3, at p. 135. This Court
has pointed out that at common law, the modern rules with respect to costs have
objectives that are not limited to compensation. For example, an order as to
costs could penalize a party who has refused a reasonable settlement offer. It
could also be used to sanction conduct that increased the duration or the
expense of litigation, or that was otherwise unreasonable or vexatious:
Okanagan Indian Band, at para. 25. In the common law provinces, therefore,
the purpose of costs is not limited to compensation, but also includes
repression. In this sense, costs differ from an order to pay extrajudicial fees
as damages in Quebec law. These differences must be taken into account when
considering judgments on these issues from the other provinces. [171]                     
The trial judge did not refer to any Quebec
cases in which extrajudicial fees had been awarded in respect of pro bono
representation. Rather, she turned to the case law of the Ontario Court of
Appeal, which has stated on various occasions that a pro bono
representation agreement is no bar to an award of costs: see, inter alia, 1465778 Ontario Inc.; Human Rights Commission (Ont.) v. Brillinger (2004),
185 O.A.C. 366; Reynolds v. Kingston (Police Services Board), 2007 ONCA 375, 86 O.R. (3d) 43. Since costs at common law are
different in nature from extrajudicial fees in Quebec law, the comparison was
inappropriate. [172]                     
In this Court, the appellant relies on art. 1608
C.C.Q. in support of the awarding of extrajudicial fees in an abuse of
process case despite the existence of a pro bono agreement. This is the
first time art. 1608 has been raised in this context. It reads as follows:                     1608.
The obligation of the debtor to pay damages to the creditor is neither reduced
nor altered by the fact that the creditor receives a benefit from a third
person, as a result of the injury he has suffered, except so far as the third
person is subrogated to the rights of the creditor. [173]                     
The interveners Centre Pro Bono Québec and Pro
Bono Law Ontario submit that this is exactly what happened in the situation now
before us: counsel, acting on a pro bono basis, indemnified the victim
of an abuse of process for the injury he sustained, and this intervention by a
third person did not release the debtor from his obligation to make reparation
for the injury. The AGC disputes this assertion, arguing that the damage that
is normally compensable by an order to pay extrajudicial fees in a case of
abuse of process is non-existent when representation is without cost. A party
that is the victim of such an abuse cannot be a “creditor” within the meaning
of art. 1608 C.C.Q. [174]                     
On its face, the AGC’s argument is appealing.
The Court of Appeal held in Viel that the damage sustained by a party as
a result of an abuse of process is the obligation to pay unnecessary legal
fees: para. 79. If there is a pro bono agreement, the victim of
the abuse of process pays no fees to his or her counsel (subject to the
particulars of the agreement in each case). On the basis of this reasoning,
given that the victim of the abuse of process has suffered no damage, he or she
cannot be a creditor of the party whose conduct constituted such an abuse. [175]                     
However, if this were true in the case of an
abuse of process, it would also have to be true in the other situations to
which art. 1608 C.C.Q. applies. A person who suffers an injury caused by
the fault of another person but receives an indemnity or a benefit from a third
person under a contract of insurance or a contract of employment has not really
suffered an injury either. But it is clear from the commentary of the Minister
of Justice from the time of enactment of the C.C.Q. that it is to that
type of situation in particular that art. 1608 C.C.Q. applies:                     [translation]
[This article] is intended to resolve the question of whether the
obligation on a debtor to compensate can be reduced or altered by payments made
to the creditor by a third party, whether those payments are gratuitous or for
consideration. This would be the case if, for example, without being required
to do so, the creditor’s employer continued to pay him his salary while he was
unable to work; it would also be the case if the creditor’s insurer paid him,
in his capacity as an insured, the proceeds of an insurance policy he had taken
out.                     Giving a negative answer to this question may
sometimes result in giving the creditor double compensation — what he
receives from the third party and what he is paid by the debtor — and so
conferring an enrichment on him; such an answer may also seem contrary to the
principle of compensation for injury, since in some cases the injury may no
longer exist as the third party may have already given compensation for it.                     On the other hand, an affirmative answer
seems contrary to the preventive function of the obligation to compensate, and
may also lead to the somewhat disturbing result of relieving the debtor of any
obligation to compensate solely as the result of the good will of a third party
or the creditor’s foresight in protecting himself at his own expense against
the possibility of the injury.                     The article comes down in favour of a negative
answer to this question of whether the debtor’s obligation to compensate may be
reduced or altered by payments the creditor receives from a third party; but so
as to avoid the principal cases in which double compensation would result, it
expressly excludes situations where the third party is legally or by agreement
subrogated to the creditor’s rights.                     This is the solution which seems fairest in the
circumstances, especially as most of the payments made by third parties —
social security indemnities, insurance payments or payments resulting from
collective labour agreements — are not really in the nature of an indemnity and
in any case are not meant to compensate for the injury sustained by the
creditor. [Emphasis added.] (Ministère de la
Justice, Commentaires du ministre de la Justice, vol. I, Le Code
civil du Québec — Un mouvement de société (1993), at p. 994) [176]                     
We are aware that the drafting of art. 1608 C.C.Q.
may have left something to be desired: “. . . that the creditor receives a
benefit from a third person, as a result of the injury he has suffered .
. . .” However, the legislature’s intent is unambiguous, and we must give
effect to it. Moreover, this interpretation is consistent with art. 1440 C.C.Q.:                     1440.
A contract has effect only between the contracting parties; it does not affect
third persons, except where provided by law. [177]                     
Litigants are required to refrain from conduct
that would amount to an abuse of process. A litigant who defaults on this
obligation commits a fault and may be ordered to pay damages. By virtue of art.
1608 C.C.Q., the litigant’s obligation to pay damages to the other party
is neither reduced nor altered by the fact that the latter received a
gratuitous benefit from his or her counsel. The rationale for art. 1608 C.C.Q.,
which is explained in the Minister of Justice’s commentary, applies with equal
force in a case of abuse of process: damages must be allowed to fully perform
their preventive function, and a person who causes an “injury” must not be
exempted from liability. [178]                     
Article 1608 C.C.Q. also attests to the
legislature’s intention not to relieve debtors of their obligation to
compensate even if this may result in double recovery for the victim. The
legislature chose to exclude cases involving subrogation, as they are the ones
that most often give rise to double recovery. The courts must defer to that
choice. This means that, contrary to what the trial judge said, it is not
necessary for the pro bono agreement to stipulate that any extrajudicial
fees that might be awarded are to be paid to counsel. It is up to the parties
and their counsel to negotiate the particulars of such agreements. [179]                     
Having made these clarifications, we will now
consider the trial judge’s finding that the AGC’s conduct in this case amounted
to an abuse of process. In particular, she stressed the fact that the AGC had -
    insisted that Mr. Hinse prove every little detail; -
    refused to give him certain documents; -
    faulted Mr. Hinse for failing to call the decision makers who had played a
role in his case to testify before the court; -
    repeatedly stated that it was up to Mr. Hinse to discharge his burden of
proof; -
    blindly endorsed the theory of his own experts; -
    waited until November 2, 2010, the first day of the trial, to acknowledge
that Mr. Hinse was the victim of a miscarriage of justice; -
    refused to allow the report of the Commission de police to be filed in the
record; and -
    contended that the witnesses who provided the “new evidence” adduced in the
Court of Appeal that led to the stay of proceedings in June 1994 should be
heard (para. 226). [180]                     
Like the Court of Appeal, however, we can see no
abuse of process in the AGC’s conduct. It is true that the position taken by Dr.
Chamberland, a psychiatric expert, that the effects of Mr. Hinse’s
incarceration had been “beneficial” was unfortunate; the AGC should have
disassociated himself from it. But this on its own does not amount to an abuse
of process. The AGC did not multiply proceedings in an unreasonable manner or
call unnecessary witnesses. He did not use procedural mechanisms excessively or
unreasonably, nor did he act in bad faith or recklessly. The law on the federal
Crown’s liability for a fault committed by the Minister in exercising his or
her power of mercy was far from clear at the time of the dispute. It was
reasonable and appropriate for the AGC to contest the appellant’s action and
raise the defence that he did. The trial judge committed a palpable and
overriding error in finding that there had been an abuse of process in the
context of this case. The appellant was not entitled to the extrajudicial fees
that were awarded. V.    Disposition [181]                     
There is no denying that the miscarriage of
justice of which Mr. Hinse was a victim is most regrettable. However, in the
absence of bad faith or serious recklessness on the Minister’s part, and of a
causal connection between his actions and the alleged damage, Mr. Hinse’s
action against the AGC must fail. We would dismiss the appeal without costs, as
the Court of Appeal did. APPENDIX Criminal
