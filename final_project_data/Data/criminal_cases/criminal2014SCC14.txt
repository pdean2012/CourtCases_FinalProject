from a judgment of the Alberta Court of Appeal (Martin and Watson JJ.A. and
Sulatycky J. (ad hoc)), 2013 ABCA 219, 553 A.R. 282, 583 W.A.C. 282,
2013 CarswellAlta 990, [2013] A.J. No. 619 (QL), setting aside the accused’s
acquittal on a charge of sexual assault and entering a conviction.  Appeal
dismissed.                      Alain Hepner, Q.C., for the appellant.                      Christine Rideout, for the respondent.                      The judgment
of the Court was delivered orally by [1]                             
Moldaver J. — We agree with the
conclusion of the Court of Appeal.  In particular, taking the record at its
highest for the appellant, there was no evidence that the appellant took any
reasonable steps to ascertain whether the complainant was consenting to sexual
relations following her initial rejection of the appellant’s sexual advances.
With respect, the trial judge erred in law in finding that there was some
evidence that he had taken reasonable steps as required by s. 273.2 (b)
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 . [2]                             
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.                     Judgment
accordingly.                      Solicitors for the
appellant:  Ross, Hepner, Calgary.                      Solicitor for the
respondent:  Attorney General of Alberta, Calgary.
