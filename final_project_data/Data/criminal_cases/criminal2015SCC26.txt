Pelham, Warden of the Bowden Institution, and the Attorney General of Canada.                      Doreen C.

David Taylor, for the intervener Amnesty
International Canada.                      The
judgment of the Court was delivered orally by  [1]               The Chief Justice — The only issue on
this appeal is what correctional facility Mr. Khadr should be placed in. This
is a question of statutory interpretation. Simply put, if Mr. Khadr’s
eight-year sentence is treated as a single global sentence for all the offences
to which he pleaded guilty, the sentence is under the minimum for an adult
sentence, with the result that s. 20 (a)(ii) of the International
Transfer of Offenders Act, S.C. 2004, c. 21  (“ITOA ”), applies and
his sentence is to be served in a provincial facility.  [2]               On the
submissions before us, we are of the view that a proper interpretation of the
relevant legislation does not permit Mr. Khadr’s eight-year sentence to be
treated as five distinct eight-year sentences to be served concurrently.  For
the purposes of placement, whatever interpretation is taken of the provisions,
s. 20 (a) of the ITOA  applies in this case, with the result that
placement should be in a provincial correctional facility.  [3]               Accordingly,
we would dismiss the appeal with costs and confirm the order of the Alberta
Court of Appeal that Mr. Khadr’s sentence is a youth sentence to be served in a
provincial correctional facility for adults.                      Judgment
accordingly.                      Solicitor for the appellants David Pelham, Warden of the Bowden
Institution, and the Attorney General of Canada: Attorney General of
Canada, Winnipeg.                      Solicitor for the
appellant Her Majesty The Queen in Right of Alberta: Attorney General of
Alberta, Edmonton.                      Solicitors for the
respondent: Beresh Aloneissi O’Neill Hurley O’Keeffe Millsap, Edmonton; Dennis
Edney, Edmonton.                      Solicitors for the
intervener the Canadian Civil Liberties Association: Lerners, Toronto.                      Solicitors for the
intervener Amnesty International Canada: Fannie Lafontaine, Québec; Power Law,
Ottawa. *   A revised judgment was issued on May 28, 2015, amending
para. 3. The amendments are included in this judgment.
