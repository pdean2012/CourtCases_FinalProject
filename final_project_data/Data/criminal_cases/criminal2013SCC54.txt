LeBel J. — Speaking
for a majority of the Court, I am of the opinion that the Court of Appeal of
Quebec did not err when, for the reasons given by Chamberland J.A., it
dismissed the appellant’s application for an extension of time, and for those
reasons, the appeal is dismissed. [2]                             
Justice Cromwell, dissenting, essentially for the reasons given by
Dalphond J.A. in dissent in the Court of Appeal, would have allowed the appeal,
granted the extension of time and returned the matter to the Court of Appeal.                     Judgment accordingly.                     Solicitors for the appellant:  Desrosiers,
Joncas, Massicotte, Montréal.                     Solicitor for the respondent:  Poursuites
criminelles et pénales du Québec, Montréal.
