from a judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal (Finch C.J. and Kirkpatrick
and Hinkson JJ.A.), 2011 BCCA 522, 314 B.C.A.C. 209, 534 W.A.C. 209, 282 C.C.C.
(3d) 352, [2011] B.C.J. No. 2463 (QL), 2011 CarswellBC 3547, setting aside the
accused’s acquittal on charges of aggravated assault and assault using a weapon,
entering convictions on those charges and entering a stay of the accused’s
conviction for criminal negligence causing bodily harm. Appeal dismissed.                     Douglas H.
Christie,
for the appellant.                     Margaret A. Mereigh, for the respondent.                     The judgment of the Court was delivered orally by [1]                             
LeBel J. — We all agree with Hinkson J.A., writing for a
unanimous Court of Appeal, that all the elements of the charges against the
appellant had been established. We will not comment on whether the charge of
assault with a weapon should have been stayed, as this issue was not raised in
this Court. Nor do we need, on the specific facts of this case, to rule
definitively on whether a circumcision performed by a person without medical
training can ever be considered reasonable and in the child’s best interest.
For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.                     Judgment accordingly.                     Solicitor
for the appellant:  Douglas H. Christie, Victoria.                     Solicitor
for the respondent:  Attorney General
of British Columbia, Vancouver.
