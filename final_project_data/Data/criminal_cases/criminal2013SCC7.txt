AZ-50721988, [2010] J.Q. no 24271, 2010 CarswellQue 15068. Appeal allowed.                     Robin Tremblay and Guy Loisel, for the appellant.                     Jean-Claude
Dufour and Patrick Jacques, for the respondent.                     English
version of the judgment of the Court delivered orally by [1]                            
Wagner J. — The Crown appeals from a judgment in which the Quebec Court
of Appeal reversed the trial judge’s decision and acquitted the respondent of
dangerous operation of his motor vehicle and of thereby causing bodily harm to
Michel Bisson and the death of Michel Rostand, contrary to s. 249  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 . [2]                            
It is common ground that passing on a double
line does not on its own suffice to establish the respondent’s criminal
liability.  All the circumstances of the case must be considered. [3]                            
The trial judge made no fatal error in finding
the respondent guilty. [4]                            
She took the relevant factors and all the
circumstances into account. [5]                            
The Court of Appeal’s intervention was therefore
not warranted. [6]                            
For these reasons, the appeal is allowed.  The
judgment of the Quebec Court of Appeal dated September 8, 2011 is set aside,
the judgment of the Court of Québec dated September 14, 2010 is restored, and
the case is remanded to the Court of Québec in the judicial district of
Baie-Comeau for sentencing submissions.                     Judgment accordingly.                     Solicitor
for the appellant:  Poursuites criminelles et pénales du Québec, Baie-Comeau.                     Solicitor for the respondent:  Jean-Claude Dufour, Baie-Comeau.
