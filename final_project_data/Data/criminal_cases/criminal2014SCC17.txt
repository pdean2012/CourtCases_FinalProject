from a judgment of the Alberta Court of Appeal (Conrad, Martin and Rowbotham JJ.A.),
2013 ABCA 257, 81 Alta. L.R. (5th) 289, 556 A.R. 129, [2013] A.J. No.
740 (QL), 2013 CarswellAlta 1157, upholding the accused’s
conviction for second degree murder.  Appeal dismissed.                      C. John Hooker and Eleanor Funk, for the appellant.                      Jolaine Antonio and Matt Dalidowicz, for the respondent.                      The judgment
of the Court was delivered orally by [1]                             
The Chief
Justice — On this appeal as of
right, the appellant raises three questions of law on which a judge of the
Alberta Court of Appeal dissented.  Two of them can be dealt with summarily. 
First, the appellant submits that the trial judge was required as part of her
instructions on reasonable doubt to specifically direct the jury that they had
to acquit both accused if they could not decide which accused had committed the
murder.  Second, the appellant submits that the trial judge failed to properly
explain to the jury the relationship between the intoxication defence and the mens
rea required for aiding and abetting in second degree murder.  For the
reasons given by Rowbotham J.A. in the Court of Appeal, we would not give
effect to these grounds. [2]                             
The third ground of appeal relates to certain
out-of-court statements made by the appellant’s co-accused and which the Crown
introduced into evidence against the co-accused as party admissions. The
appellant submits that the trial judge erred by failing to instruct the jury
that it could rely on those statements for their truth in determining their
verdict in relation to the appellant. [4]                             
There appears to be nothing that would have prevented the appellant from
attempting to have these statements considered for their truth under the
principled approach to the hearsay rule.  However, no such attempt was made
here.  There was, therefore, no basis raised for the judge to give the
instruction now sought.  We note that R. v. Edwards, 2004 BCCA 558, 205
B.C.A.C. 42, in which one accused adduced in evidence as part of his case an
inculpatory out-of-court statement by a co-accused, gives rise to different
issues which we do not have to address here. [5]                             
While that is sufficient to address the legal issues on which the dissent in the
Court of Appeal was based, we also observe that the statements made by the
appellant and his co-accused were highly unreliable on their face and tended,
in any event, to incriminate both of them. There is no suggestion that defence
counsel not pursuing the admissibility of these statements as evidence of their
truth by virtue of the principled approach to hearsay or seeking a severance so
that the co-accused would be a compellable witness were anything other than
reasonable tactical decisions. No basis has been shown to permit the appellant
to revisit these matters on appeal: see R. v. J.F., 2013 SCC 12, [2013]
1 S.C.R. 565, at para. 68. [6]                             
For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.                     Judgment
accordingly.                      Solicitors for the
appellant:  Lord, Russell, Tyndale, Hoare, Calgary.                      Solicitor for the
respondent:  Attorney General of Alberta, Calgary.
