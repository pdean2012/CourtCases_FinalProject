from a judgment of the Alberta Court of Appeal (Berger and McDonald JJ.A. and
Hughes J. (ad hoc)), 2013 ABCA 406, 90 Alta. L.R. (5th) 354, 295 C.R.R.
(2d) 233, 566 A.R. 58, 597 W.A.C. 58, [2014] 3 W.W.R.
250, [2013] A.J. No. 1261 (QL), 2013 CarswellAlta 2311, affirming the accused’s
convictions for drugs and firearms offences.  Appeal dismissed.                      Shawn Beaver and Alexandra Seaman, for
the appellant.                      James C. Martin and Louise M. Proulx, for the respondent.                      The judgment
of the Court was delivered orally by [2]                             
In our view it does not.  Assuming, without deciding, that there was a
s. 8  breach on these facts, it is clear that the trial judge conducted her s.
24(2)  analysis on the basis that the s. 10 (b) breach resulted in the
appellant producing the joint and lump of marihuana. As she put it, “While [the
police officer] gave evidence that she would have arrested Mr. Mohamed if he
had not got out of the car at her request, and I have found that she had
grounds to do so, it is not a certainty that the exhibits of marihuana would
have been discovered otherwise.  The production of the joint and the lump of
marihuana were clearly as a result of [the officer’s] prompting of Mr. Mohamed”
(A.R., vol. I, p. 57 (emphasis added)). It is thus clear that the trial judge’s
s. 24(2)  analysis would not have been different had she found an independent s.
8  breach. [3]                             
In light of that conclusion, our view is that there is no basis to
interfere on appeal with the trial judge’s weighing of the various factors
under the s. 24(2)  analysis. [4]                             
The appeal is dismissed.                     Judgment accordingly.                      Solicitors for the
appellant:  Beaver, Leebody, Frank & Simic, Edmonton.                      Solicitor for the
respondent:  Public Prosecution Service of Canada, Calgary.
