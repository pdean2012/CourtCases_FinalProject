orally by [1]                             
LeBel J. — The Court is
unanimously of the view that the appeal should be allowed.  The judge who
presided over the appellant’s trial gave, in response to a specific question
from the jury on being an accessory and being a party to an offence, additional
instructions that were incomplete and confusing.  Moreover, although we need
not rule on this issue for the purposes of this appeal, the nature of the
charges against the appellant raises the question whether it would be possible
to base a conviction for first degree murder under s. 231(5)  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , on the accused being a party to the offence
within the meaning of s. 21(2) . For these reasons, the appeal is allowed, the verdict
of guilty is set aside, and the Court orders that a new trial be held in
respect of the same charges.                     Judgment accordingly.                     Solicitors
for the appellant:  Stein Monast, Québec.                     Solicitor for the respondent:  Poursuites criminelles et
pénales du Québec, Québec.
