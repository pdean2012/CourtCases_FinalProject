The Queen                                                                               Respondent Indexed as:  R. v. Knott 2012 SCC 42 File No.:  33911. 2011:  December 14; 2012:  July 31. Present:  McLachlin C.J. and Deschamps, Fish, Abella,
Rothstein, Moldaver and Karakatsanis JJ. on appeal from the court of appeal for british columbia                     In August 2005, the appellant K
received a sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment with three years’ probation
and a concurrent sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment with three years’
probation.  Less than one month later, on a different matter, he received a
concurrent sentence of 16 months’ imprisonment with three years’ probation.  One
week before the expiry of the 24-month sentence, he received a consecutive
sentence of six months’ imprisonment.  He later received a consecutive sentence
of eight months’ imprisonment with one year’s probation.  In June 2008, the
appellant D.A.P. received a conditional sentence of two years less a day with
two years’ probation.  He breached that sentence and committed other offences. 
In February 2009, his conditional sentence was converted into a custodial term
and he received concurrent sentences of three years’ imprisonment and six
months’ imprisonment for the additional offences.  On appeal, the appellants
contested the probation orders claiming that s. 731(1) (b) of the
Criminal Code  only permits such orders where there is “imprisonment for a
term not exceeding two years”, and that this consists of the aggregate of all
custodial terms.  The Court of Appeal confirmed the probation orders.                     Held:  The appeals should be dismissed.                     The probation orders imposed on
the appellants were valid when made and no prior or subsequent sentences
invalidated them, either prospectively or retrospectively.  The phrase
“imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years” relates only to the actual
term of imprisonment imposed by a sentencing court at a single sitting.  It
does not refer to the aggregate of the custodial term imposed by the sentencing
court and all other sentences then being served or later imposed on the
offender.  Nor must a probation order come into force within two years of being
made.  Probation orders, however, may not be attached to a sentence that does
not exceed two years’ imprisonment if that sentence results in continuous custody
for more than two years when combined with other sentences imposed at the same
sentencing session.  Probation orders of this sort contravene s. 731(1) (b)
of the Criminal Code .                     In assessing the appropriateness
of a fresh probation order, however, unexpired prior sentences remain an
important consideration.  Sentencing courts cannot disregard existing probation
orders.  A sentence must take into account the particular circumstances of the
offence, the character and needs of the offender, and the purpose and relevant
principles of sentencing.  A probation order that is manifestly inappropriate
in itself or that renders a sentence unfit will be set aside on appeal. As
well, a probation order that was appropriate when made may be rendered
inappropriate by a lengthy intervening term of imprisonment. Cases Cited                     Referred to:  R. v.

Brundrett, for the
respondent.                      The judgment of the Court was
delivered by                      Fish J. — I [1]                             
Trial judges must retain as much flexibility as
the Criminal Code  permits in crafting individualized sentences that
respect the principles and purposes of sentencing set out by Parliament in the Code. [2]                             
The result sought by the appellants would have
the opposite effect.  It would limit the availability of probation orders in a
manner unwarranted by the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c.
C-46 .  More particularly, it would prevent sentencing judges from imposing, in
appropriate cases, shorter custodial terms followed by community supervision
for up to three years. [3]                             
That is what happened here.  And it is not
suggested that the sentences imposed on either appellant were excessive or
incompatible with the relevant principles of sentencing. [4]                             
The sole issue is whether the probation orders
attacked by the appellants contravene s. 731(1) (b) of the Criminal
Code .  In virtue of that provision, a court that sentences an offender to
imprisonment for “a term not exceeding two years [may] direct that the offender
comply with the conditions prescribed in a probation order”. [5]                             
None of the courts that made the probation
orders in issue here sentenced either appellant to a term of imprisonment
exceeding two years.  And they were not “merged” by law, for the purposes of s.
731(1) (b), with other sentences the appellants were then serving or
subsequently received. [6]                             
Earlier case law to the contrary has been
overtaken by this Court’s decisions in R. v. Mathieu, 2008 SCC 21,
[2008] 1 S.C.R. 723, and R. v. Middleton, 2009 SCC 21, [2009] 1 S.C.R.
674.  I refer here to prior decisions in some provinces (including British
Columbia) that struck down a probation order because the accompanying prison
sentence — in combination with other sentences imposed against the
same offender on other occasions — exceeded two years.  This was known as
the “two-year rule”. [7]                             
In the present matter, a five-member panel of
the British Columbia Court of Appeal recognized that Mathieu and Middleton
had exposed latent — and irreparable — cracks in the foundation of the
“two-year rule”.  The Court of Appeal therefore felt bound to undertake a “new
analysis” (2010 BCCA 386, 291 B.C.A.C. 236, at para. 68).  In this fresh light,
the Court of Appeal upheld all of the probation orders made against both
appellants. [8]                             
We are now urged by the appellants to set aside
the judgment of the Court of Appeal and quash the probation orders of which
they were the beneficiaries when the orders were made:  They would both have
otherwise received longer terms of imprisonment. [9]                             
Their joined appeals should both be dismissed,
not because the appellants are “sore winners”, but because any other result
would be unwarranted by the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code . 
And it would be contrary to society’s interest in ensuring its own protection
by preserving a sentencing option that favours the rehabilitation of
offenders. [10]                         
In appropriate cases, probation orders serve
that purpose as an effective and efficient alternative to unnecessary
institutional confinement (Mathieu, at para. 20; R. v. Proulx,
2000 SCC 5, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, at para. 32; R. v. Shoker, 2006 SCC 44,
[2006] 2 S.C.R. 399, at para. 10). II [11]                         
On August 18, 2005, Mr. Knott received
concurrent sentences of 24 months’ imprisonment on one information and 12
months’ on another, with three years’ probation added to each sentence.  On
September 8, 2005, less than one month later, he was sentenced on a different
matter to 16 months’ imprisonment and three years’ probation.  At the
Crown’s suggestion, the trial judge ordered the term of imprisonment to be
served concurrently with Mr. Knott’s existing sentences. [12]                         
Mr. Knott was back in court on August 10, 2007,
approximately one week before the expiry of his previously imposed 24-month
sentence.  Mr. Knott again pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six months’
imprisonment, consecutive to the term he was already serving.  Finally,
on December 3, 2007, he was sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment,
consecutive to his existing sentences, to be followed by probation for one
year. [13]                         
By the end of 2007, Mr. Knott had thus
accumulated four separate probation orders, each to come into force in
accordance with s. 732.2(1) (b) of the Criminal Code :                            732.2 (1) A probation order comes into force . . .                            (b)     where
the offender is sentenced to imprisonment under paragraph 731(1) (b) or
was previously sentenced to imprisonment for another offence, as soon as the
offender is released from prison or, if released from prison on conditional
release, at the expiration of the sentence of imprisonment; . . . [14]                         
On August 2, 2008, Mr. Knott was due for release
in respect of all the offences mentioned, having served a total of 2 years, 11
months, and 16 days. But he remained in custody on another matter until
December 17, 2008. [15]                         
The other appellant, D.A.P., received a conditional
sentence of two years less a day on June 3, 2008, to be followed by two years’
probation.  On February 19, 2009, D.A.P. pleaded guilty to having breached his
conditional sentence order, along with other offences.  His conditional
sentence was converted into a custodial term and he was sentenced on the same
day to three years’ imprisonment for one offence and six months’ concurrent for
another.  Both fresh sentences were made concurrent to any other sentences that
D.A.P. was then serving. [16]                         
In this context, a brief word concerning the
imposition of multiple probation orders in this case. [17]                         
Sentencing courts may impose separate but
concurrent probation orders, attached to different counts.  This may be done to
add supplementary conditions appropriate in the circumstances of different
offences, or to ensure that the offender will remain subject to probation if
one of the probation orders is later set aside or rendered inoperative. [18]                         
While multiple probation orders may be made in
this manner, no probation order may continue for more than three years from the
date on which it came into force (Criminal Code, s. 732.2(2) (b)),
subject to the exception involving subsequent convictions once a probation
order has already come into force (s. 732.2(5) ). III [19]                         
Mr. Knott appealed his August 18, 2005,
September 8, 2005 and December 3, 2007 sentences, seeking to have the probation
orders quashed. D.A.P. appealed his June 3, 2008 sentence, seeking the same
outcome. [20]                         
As mentioned earlier, the Court of Appeal took
these sentence appeals as an opportunity to revisit the law.  Sitting as a
five-judge panel, the Court of Appeal reached three principal conclusions. [21]                         
First, the court concluded that, where a
sentencing court imposes terms of imprisonment at a single sentencing hearing that
would — either individually or cumulatively — exceed two years, probation
cannot be ordered as well. [22]                         
Second, the court held that, if an offender is
subject to a term of imprisonment imposed on a prior occasion, and a court
orders a subsequent sentence that would exceed two years when combined with the
unexpired portion (or “remanet”) of the existing sentence, it “would, except in
the rarest of cases, be an error in principle” for the sentencing court to also
make a probation order under s. 731(1) (b) (para. 73). [23]                         
Third, the court held that the remanet analysis
applies only where the subsequent sentencing court makes a fresh
probation order.  Subsequent sentences of whatever length (other than
imprisonment for life) were held not to invalidate any existing probation
order. [24]                         
Applying these findings of law to the facts in
each instance, the Court of Appeal, as I have already mentioned, confirmed all
of the probation orders imposed against Mr. Knott and D.A.P., and dismissed
their appeals. IV [25]                         
The British Columbia Court of Appeal was not the
first court to question or reject the two-year rule previously applied (see R. v. Pickell, 2007 CanLII 25672 (Ont.
S.C.J.)).  It did nonetheless chart new territory in this case.  The court had previously decided
that an intervening sentence could invalidate a once lawful probation
order (R. v. Amyotte, 2005 BCCA 12, 192 C.C.C. (3d) 412; R. v. Pawlak, 2005 BCCA 500, 217 B.C.A.C.
146; R. v. McKinnon, 2008 BCCA 416, 237 C.C.C. (3d) 345).  So, too, had
other provincial courts of appeal (R. v. Miller (1987), 36 C.C.C. (3d)
100 (Ont.); R. v. Lucas, 2009 NLCA 56, 293 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 90). [26]                         
It had also been previously held, both in
British Columbia and in Ontario, that probation cannot be ordered where the
offender is subject to multiple sentences that, if aggregated, would exceed two
years (R. v. Pauls, 2008 BCCA 322
(CanLII); R. v. K. (K.), 2009 ONCA 254, 244 C.C.C. (3d) 124). [27]                         
While the case law on this latter point was
divided, the disagreement generally related to how, not whether,
sentences were to be aggregated for the purposes of s. 731(1) (b).  Some
decisions calculated the “aggregate sentence” from the date the first sentence
was imposed to the date the final sentence would expire (R. v. Hendrix (1999),
137 C.C.C. (3d) 445 (Nfld. C.A.); R. v. Renouf, 2001 NFCA 56, 160 C.C.C.
(3d) 173; R. v. Weir, 2004 BCCA 529 (CanLII)).  Others added the
subsequent sentence to the remanet of previously imposed sentences (R. v.
Currie (1982), 65 C.C.C. (2d) 415 (Ont. C.A.)). [28]                         
For the most part, these decisions relied
implicitly, if not explicitly, on the sentence merger provisions in s. 139  of
the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, S.C. 1992, c. 20  (“CCRA ”),
and its predecessors.  This is no longer possible in light of Middleton,
where the majority held that s. 139  was enacted for administrative purposes
relating to parole and remission, and had no substantive impact on an
offender’s eligibility for an otherwise lawful sentence. [29]                         
In my respectful view, s. 139  of the CCRA  is
therefore of no assistance in determining the legality of a probation order. [30]                         
The remaining question, to which I now turn, is
whether s. 731(1) (b) — in itself — prohibits the making of the probation
orders that concern us here. V [31]                         
Section 731(1)  of the Criminal Code  provides:                            731. (1) Where
a person is convicted of an offence, a court may, having regard to the age and
character of the offender, the nature of the offence and the circumstances
surrounding its commission,                            (a)     if
no minimum punishment is prescribed by law, suspend the passing of sentence and
direct that the offender be released on the conditions prescribed in a
probation order; or                            (b)     in addition to fining or
sentencing the offender to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years,
direct that the offender comply with the conditions prescribed in a probation
order. [32]                         
The Crown submits that the phrase “imprisonment
for a term not exceeding two years” in s. 731(1) (b) relates only to the
actual term of imprisonment imposed by a sentencing court at a single sitting. 
The appellants argue that “term” of imprisonment referred to in that provision
is the aggregate of the custodial term imposed by the sentencing court and all
other sentences then being served or later imposed on the offender.  In my
view, the Crown’s submission is correct and the appellants’ submission fails. [33]                         
The ordinary meaning of s. 731(1) (b) is
perfectly clear:  A probation order may not be made where the sentencing
court imposes a term of imprisonment exceeding two years.  In determining
whether two years has been exceeded, one looks at the term of imprisonment
ordered by the sentencing court on that occasion — not at other
sentences imposed by other courts on other occasions for other
matters. [34]                         
Section 731(1) (b) admits of no ambiguity
in this regard.  The opening words of s. 731(1)  read: “Where a person is
convicted of an offence, a court may”. The provision authorizes that court
to make a probation order, “in addition to fining or sentencing the offender to
imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years”.  On a plain reading of this
provision, the phrase “imprisonment
for a term not exceeding two years” refers to the
sentence imposed by the court empowered by s. 731(1)  to make the
probation order. [35]                         
Had Parliament intended unexpired sentences from
other occasions to be included in the phrase “imprisonment for a term . . . exceeding
two years”, it would have said so. The language was close at hand.  Section
743.1  of the Criminal Code , for example, expressly provides for the
aggregation of sentences in determining whether an offender is to be sent to
the penitentiary. [36]                         
The appellants submit that the two-year
limitation in s. 731(1) (b) reflects Parliament’s intention that
probation orders not be imposed on offenders subject, even for reasons
unrelated to the sentence accompanied by the probation order, to more than two
years’ imprisonment.  There is some support for this view in Miller,
where the Ontario Court of Appeal held that                     the
principle governing s. 663(1)(b) [now s. 731(1) (b)] of the Code
is that Parliament intended that a probation order would not come into effect
more than two years from the time of sentencing and that an accused would not
be made subject to a probation order, if required to serve a sentence of more
than two years.  [p. 104] [37]                         
With respect, this articulation of Parliament’s
intent is consistent with neither the language of s. 731(1) (b), nor its statutory
context. [38]                         
Section 731(1) (b) does not address the
coming into force of a probation order.  The provision empowers the
sentencing court to make a probation order as part of the sentence.  The
availability of this non-custodial sentencing option is restricted where the
required custodial portion of the sentence exceeds two years.  But the coming
into force of the order is not dealt with at all in s. 731(1) (b). [39]                         
For that, one must look to s. 732.2  of the Criminal
Code . [40]                         
Nowhere does s. 732.2  — or any other provision
of the Criminal Code  — provide that a probation order must come into
force within two years of it being made. [41]                         
My interpretation of s. 731(1) (b) is
supported as well by the purposive approach outlined in Mathieu.  As
I stated at the outset, the policy considerations underpinning probation orders
are best promoted by an interpretation that preserves their availability to
trial judges. [42]                         
It is well established that probation orders are
intended to facilitate an offender’s rehabilitation (Mathieu, at para.
20; Proulx, at para. 32).  An
interpretation of the phrase “imprisonment
for a term not exceeding two years” that includes all
outstanding sentences would have the undesirable consequence of making
probation orders unavailable to offenders who might well benefit from them (Mathieu,
at para. 22). [43]                         
The sentencing objectives set out by Parliament
in ss. 718  to 718.2  of the Criminal Code  are best achieved by preserving
— not curtailing — a sentencing court’s arsenal of non-custodial sentencing
options.  Probation orders, where available and appropriate, serve that purpose
well:  They afford sentencing judges the flexibility to opt for shorter prison
terms followed by community supervision, rather than the longer prison terms
that they would have otherwise unnecessarily imposed to achieve the same ends. [44]                         
The appellants’ interpretation of s. 731(1) (b),
rejected in Mathieu (at para. 22), would have the undesirable
consequence of increasing the custodial portion of an offender’s sentences
without any countervailing correctional advantage or benefit to society. [45]                         
Not infrequently, the offender and society will
both benefit from a probation order that comes into force following
imprisonment for an aggregate period of more than two years (Mathieu, at
para. 20).  The offender has the benefit of a shorter sentence of imprisonment,
and society benefits from constraints aimed at facilitating rehabilitation and
protecting society (Shoker, at para. 10). [46]                         
There will, of course, be situations in which a
probation order may not serve a useful purpose when it follows a lengthy term
of imprisonment.  Parliament has anticipated this possibility by including both
preventive and curative antidotes in the sentencing provisions of the Code. [47]                         
I take care not to be understood to have
expressed here a decided view on sentencing issues that are not now but may one
day confront the Court.  Subject to that reservation, I think it fair to say
that the purpose and principles of sentencing set out in the Criminal Code 
are meant to take into account the correctional imperative of sentence
individualization.  Consistent with this approach and subject to the conditions
set out in s. 731(1)(b) of the Code, questions related to the
fitness of probation orders in particular cases — as opposed to their
availability in principle — are best left to be dealt with by the courts on a
case-by-case basis as a matter of fitness. [48]                         
Before returning to the Code’s remedies
against probation orders that render a sentence unfit when it is imposed, I
acknowledge that neither Cartesian logic nor textual exegesis can
satisfactorily resolve every perceived anomaly. [49]                         
For example, it may appear anomalous to cause
the validity of a probation order to depend on whether the relevant sentences
were imposed at a single session or on different occasions.  I have already
explained why the availability of a probation order depends on the “term of
imprisonment” imposed when the order is made. [50]                         
How, then, do we deal with probation orders
attached to sentences that, likewise, do not exceed two years’ imprisonment —
but do result in continuous custody for more than two years in combination with
other sentences imposed on the same offender by the same sentencing court at
the same session? [51]                         
It has consistently been held by courts across
the country that probation orders of this sort contravene s. 731(1) (b)
(see, for example, R. v. Young (1980), 27 C.R. (3d) 85 (B.C.C.A.); R.
v. Hennigar (1983), 58 N.S.R. (2d) 110 (S.C. (App. Div.)); R. v. McPhee
(1993), 128 N.S.R. (2d) 79 (C.A.); R. v. Amaralik (1984), 16 C.C.C. (3d)
22 (N.W.T.C.A.); R. v. Hackett (1986), 30 C.C.C. (3d) 159 (B.C.C.A.); R.
v. Gill (1994), 162 A.R. 163 (C.A.); and R. v. H.J.P. (1995), 133 Nfld. &
P.E.I.R. 20 (Nfld. C.A.)). [52]                         
While some of these cases invoked s. 139  of the CCRA 
and its predecessors, I believe they were nonetheless correctly decided
pursuant to s. 731(1)  alone, bearing in mind the “totality” principle that
remains unchallenged on this appeal. [53]                         
The appellants argue in this regard that the
interpretation of s. 731(1) (b) adopted by the Court of Appeal is
problematic in that it treats similarly situated offenders differently
depending on the timing of a sentence.  For example, an offender who is
sentenced on different days to two years’ imprisonment for one offence and one
year consecutive for another may be subject to probation, while an offender who
receives identical terms of imprisonment at the same hearing would not. [54]                         
This apparent anomaly, or inconsistency, must
yield to Parliament’s intent, and the best indication of Parliament’s intent is
the provisions it has enacted. [55]                         
I need hardly add that it would be a reviewable
error for a sentencing court to exploit this difference for the sole purpose of
circumventing the two-year rule in s. 731(1) (b). For example, in a
proceeding involving multiple counts, indictments, or informations, the
sentencing court must not adjourn the sentencing on some of the offences in
order to make a probation order that would otherwise contravene s. 731(1) (b). [56]                         
Moreover, sentencing and appellate courts are
empowered to ensure that probation orders are made and applied in an
even-handed and appropriate manner. Judicial discretion — and the checks placed
upon it — are sufficient to ensure that this scheme is fairly applied. VI [57]                         
In light of the foregoing, I agree with the
Court of Appeal that s. 731(1) (b) does not invalidate probation
orders imposed on prior occasions. [58]                         
With respect, however, I take a somewhat
different view of fresh probation orders.  Like the Ontario Court of Appeal in Currie
(at p. 416), the British Columbia Court of Appeal held in this case that,
“[w]hen the sentence is imposed on a remanet, and the total of the new sentence
and the remanet exceeds two years, probation should not be ordered” (para. 74). [59]                         
And, again as in Currie, the Court of
Appeal held here that the sentencing court has the jurisdiction to impose a
fresh probation order in such circumstances — but it would generally be an
error in principle to do so (para. 73).  This conclusion was based on the
view that s. 731(1) (b) “makes it clear that the intention of Parliament
was to limit probation orders to situations where the sentence to be served
does not exceed two years” (ibid.). [60]                         
If it is an error in principle to make a
probation order that follows an aggregate sentence of more than two years, the
principle does not arise from s. 731 . As I earlier explained, s. 731(1) (b)
does not reflect any sort of Parliamentary intention that probation orders be
limited to situations where the sentence to be served does not exceed two
years. [61]                         
But probation orders permitted by s. 731(1) (b)
are, like other elements of a sentence, subject to review for their fitness. 
Courts are precluded by the relevant sentencing principles from making a
probation order that is clearly unreasonable in the circumstances (R. v.
Shropshire, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227).  Put differently, a probation order that
is manifestly inappropriate in itself or that renders unfit the sentence of
which it is a part will be set aside on appeal. [62]                         
In considering whether a fresh probation order
is appropriate, the sentencing court must thus take into account the particular
circumstances of the offence, the character and needs of the offender, and the
purpose and relevant principles of sentencing (R. v. Nasogaluak, 2010
SCC 6, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, at para. 43). [63]                         
In short, unexpired prior sentences remain an
important consideration, though not necessarily decisive, in determining whether
a probation order is appropriate. VII [64]                         
A probation order that was appropriate when made
may well be rendered inappropriate by a lengthy intervening term of
imprisonment. [65]                         
For example, where a probation order will not
come into force for many years after its imposition, or where the total period
of incarceration is extended to the point that the offender will be subject to
a lengthy period of community supervision while on parole or statutory release,
a probation order will generally lack a meaningful rehabilitative purpose. [66]                         
 Existing probation orders are not automatically
invalidated in these situations, but this does not mean that subsequent
sentencing courts may disregard them. Quite the contrary. Sentencing judges
must take into consideration a probation order that, pursuant to s. 732.2 of
the Code, will come into force following any additional terms of
imprisonment imposed by that court. [67]                         
Sentencing judges should also ensure that
offenders understand that probation orders previously imposed are not
automatically invalidated by the imposition of additional terms of
imprisonment. [68]                         
Moreover, where a fresh sentence may be thought
to strip an existing probation order of its rehabilitative purpose, the
sentencing judge should explain the substance of s. 732.2(3)  of the Criminal
Code  to the offender. Pursuant to that provision, an offender,
probation officer or prosecutor may apply at any time to the court that made
the probation order to have the probationary period decreased or in effect
terminated. [69]                         
The court that made the original probation order
would have already caused an explanation of this provision to be given to the
offender (s. 732.1(5) ). However, as the procedure contemplated by s. 732.2(3) 
is properly applied where an additional sentence overtakes a probation order,
it is appropriate to remind the offender of his or her rights in this regard at
the time of the subsequent sentencing. [70]                         
Finally, provided that the statutory and
procedural requirements are met, the offender or the Crown may apply to the
sentencing court itself under s. 732.2(3)  to have an outstanding
probation order varied or decreased. VIII [71]                         
For the reasons given, all of the probation
orders attacked by the appellants were valid when made and no prior or
subsequent sentences imposed on either appellant had, or could have had, the
effect of invalidating any of their probation orders, either prospectively or
retrospectively. [72]                         
Accordingly, as mentioned at the outset, I would
affirm the judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal and dismiss the
appeals of Mr. Knott and D.A.P. to this Court.                     Appeals dismissed.                     Solicitor for the appellant Damon
William Knott:  Anna King, Vancouver.                     Solicitor for the appellant
D.A.P.:  Eric Purtzki, Vancouver.                     Solicitor
for the respondent:  Attorney General of British Columbia, Vancouver.
