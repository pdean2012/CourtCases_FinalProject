following is the judgment delivered orally by [1]                             
The
Court — In
our view, the British Columbia Court of Appeal correctly concluded that s. 794(2)  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c.
C-46 , properly interpreted, imposes a persuasive burden on the accused to prove
an “exception, exemption, proviso, excuse or qualification prescribed by law”.
We do not think it appropriate to deal with the new issues raised by the
interveners. [2]                             
The appeal is dismissed.                     Judgment
accordingly.                      Solicitor for the
appellant:  Vincent Michaels Law Corporation, Vancouver.                      Solicitor for the respondent: 
Attorney General of British Columbia, Vancouver.                      Solicitor for the
intervener the Attorney General of Ontario:  Attorney General of Ontario,
Toronto.                      Solicitor for the
intervener the Attorney General of Alberta:  Attorney General of Alberta,
Calgary.
