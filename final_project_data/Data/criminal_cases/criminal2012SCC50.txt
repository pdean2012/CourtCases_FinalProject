from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Quebec (Duval Hesler C.J.Q., Dalphond
and Kasirer JJ.A.), 2011 QCCA 2012, 90 C.R. (6th) 38, SOQUIJ AZ-50799783, [2011]
J.Q. no 15669 (QL), 2011 CarswellQue 12372, setting aside the
accused’s conviction for being a party to drug-related offences entered by
Chevalier J., 2008 QCCQ 7960, SOQUIJ AZ-50513168, [2008] J.Q. no
8940 (QL), 2008 CarswellQue 8968. Appeal dismissed, Cromwell J. dissenting.                     Jean Campeau and Christine Lafrance, for the appellant.                     Julie
Giroux and Alexandre Bergevin, for the respondent.                     François
Lacasse, for the intevener.                     English version of the judgment of
the Court delivered orally by [1]                             
Fish J. — It is unnecessary to decide in this case whether an omission
“to do anything” can serve as a basis for conviction under s. 21(1) (b)
of the Criminal Code , where the accused did not have a duty to act. [2]                             
In light of the trial judge’s findings of fact,
we agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal that the evidence was
insufficient to establish to the required degree of certainty that the
respondent had acted, or failed to act, for the purpose of aiding any person to
commit the crimes mentioned in the indictment, even if that was clearly the
result. [3]                             
For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed. [4]                             
Cromwell J., dissenting, would have allowed the
appeal, substantially for the reasons given by Dalphond J.A., dissenting in the
Court of Appeal.                     Judgment accordingly.                     Solicitor
for the appellant:  Jean Campeau, Gatineau.                     Solicitors
for the respondent:  Bergevin &
Associés, Montréal.                     Solicitor
for the interverner: Public Prosecution Service of Canada, Ottawa.
