Her Majesty The Queen                                                                              Respondent Indexed as:  R. v. Ibanescu 2013 SCC 31 File No.:  34653. 2013:  May 15; 2013:  May 30. Present:  McLachlin C.J. and LeBel, Fish, Abella, Rothstein,
Cromwell, Moldaver, Karakatsanis and Wagner JJ. on appeal from the court of appeal for quebec                     Criminal
law — Evidence — Operation of vehicle with blood alcohol level exceeding legal
limit — Section 258(1) (d.1) of Criminal Code  providing that, absent evidence to
contrary, breathalyser reading above 80 mg of alcohol per 100 mL of blood is
proof that blood alcohol concentration exceeded legal limit at time of driving
— Evidence placing appellant’s blood alcohol concentration in range that
straddled legal limit at time of driving — Whether “straddle evidence” can
rebut statutory presumption.                     Held: 
The appeal should be allowed.                     The
straddle evidence in this case was admissible and the trial judge committed no
error in finding that the statutory presumption had been rebutted.  Nor did the
trial judge commit any error in weighing the appellant’s other indicia of
impairment. Cases Cited                     Applied:
 R. v. Gibson, 2008 SCC 16, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 397.                     APPEAL
from a judgment of the Quebec Court of Appeal (Duval Hesler C.J. and Dalphond
and Bich JJ.A.), 2011 QCCA 2304, SOQUIJ AZ-50813303, [2011] J.Q. no 18752
(QL), 2011 CarswellQue 13644, setting aside the accused’s acquittal and
substituting a conviction.  Appeal allowed.                     Rose-Mélanie
Drivod, for the appellant.                     Dennis
Galiatsatos and Benoit Lauzon, for the
respondent.                     The following is the judgment
delivered by [1]                             
The Court — In R. v. Gibson, 2008 SCC 16,
[2008] 1 S.C.R. 397, a majority of this Court — for the reasons of LeBel and
Deschamps JJ. — held that straddle evidence is admissible to rebut the
statutory presumption that the blood alcohol level of the accused exceeded the
legal limit at the time of driving, although there was disagreement on the
issue of the probative value of this evidence. In our view, a statement of a
legal principle that is accepted by a majority of the Court constitutes the
opinion of the Court with respect to that legal principle. This is so even if
some of the members of the Court who endorse that legal principle dissent from
the majority’s disposition of the appeal. Therefore, the straddle evidence in
this appeal was admissible. [2]                             
With respect to the probative value of the
evidence, we would adopt the reasons of LeBel J. in Gibson as setting
out the appropriate test. [3]                             
Applying these principles, we would allow the
appeal.  LeBel J. in Gibson found that straddle evidence showing blood
alcohol content between 40 mg of alcohol per 100 mL of blood, assuming an
elimination rate of 20 mg per hour, and 82 mg, assuming an elimination rate of
10 mg, “may be capable of raising a reasonable doubt” as to whether the
accused’s blood alcohol content exceeded the legal limit at the time of driving
(para. 72).  The straddle range in this case was almost identical to LeBel J.’s
example, placing the appellant’s blood alcohol content within a range of 57 mg,
assuming an elimination rate of 15 mg, and 83 mg, assuming a rate of 10 mg, at
the time of driving.  The trial judge who, in accordance with LeBel J.’s
reasons in Gibson, weighed this evidence in the light of all of the
evidence at trial, committed no legal error in finding that the statutory
presumption had been rebutted.  Nor did the trial judge commit any palpable or
overriding errors in weighing the appellant’s other indicia of impairment (2009
QCCQ 4279 (CanLII)). [4]                             
Accordingly, we would allow the appeal and
reinstate the appellant’s acquittal at trial.                     Appeal
allowed.                     Solicitors for
the appellant:  Schurman, Longo, Grenier, Montréal.                     Solicitor for the
respondent:  Poursuites criminelles et pénales du Québec, Montréal.
