Karakatsanis J. — This is an appeal as of right on a question
of law.  We agree with the majority of the Quebec Court of Appeal that it was
open to the trial judge to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the
complainant would not have engaged in sexual relations had he known about the
appellant’s HIV positive status.  The fact that the trial judge also found that
it was possible that the sexual relationship continued after disclosure,
despite the complainant’s denial, does not necessarily render that first
finding unreasonable.  While it would have been preferable for the trial judge
to more fully explain his reasoning relating to the complainant’s credibility,
we are not satisfied that the trial judge erred in the analytical process set
out in R. v. W. (D.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742, or that he failed to analyze
the evidence as a whole relating to an ultimate issue.  The appeal is
dismissed.                     Judgment
accordingly.                      Solicitors for the
appellant:  Boro, Polnicky, Lighter, Montréal.                      Solicitor for the
respondent:  Director of Criminal and Penal Prosecution Services of Quebec, Montréal.                      Solicitors for the
intervener the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network:  Cooper, Sandler, Shime &
Bergman, Toronto.                      Solicitor for the
intervener the HIV & AIDS Legal Clinic Ontario:  HIV & AIDS Legal
Clinic Ontario, Toronto.                      Solicitor for the intervener Coalition des organismes communautaires
québécois de lutte contre le sida:  Coalition des organismes communautaires
québécois de lutte contre le sida, Montréal.
