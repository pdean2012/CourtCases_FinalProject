LeBel J. — We agree with Richard J.A., who dissented in the Court of Appeal,
that the trial judge had acquitted the accused on the basis of a reasonable
doubt and that he had committed no fatal error of law in reaching that
decision.  For these reasons, the appeal of the appellant Picot is allowed, the
judgment of the New Brunswick Court of Appeal ordering a new trial is set aside
and the acquittal of the appellant entered by Ouellette J. of the New Brunswick
Court of Queen’s Bench is restored.                     Judgment accordingly.                     Solicitors
for the appellant:  Vincent Dagenais Gibson, Ottawa.                     Solicitor
for the respondent:  Attorney General
of New Brunswick, Campbellton.
