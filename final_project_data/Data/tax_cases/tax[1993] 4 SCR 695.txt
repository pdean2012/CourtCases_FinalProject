Symes v. Canada, [1993] 4
S.C.R. 695  Elizabeth C. Symes                                                                            Appellant  v.  Her Majesty The Queen                                                                   Respondent  and  The Attorney General of Quebec, the Charter Committee on Poverty
Issues and the Canadian Bar Association                                                           Interveners  Indexed as:  Symes v.
Canada  File No.:  22659.  1993:  March 2;
1993:  December 16.   on appeal from the federal court of
appeal                          In this case
arguments can be made for and against the classification of the appellant's
child care expenses as business expenses.  While it is clear that the appellant
would not have incurred child care expenses except for her business, it is
equally clear that the need which is met by child care expenses exists
regardless of the appellant's business activity.  As well, while there is no
evidence to suggest that child care expenses are considered business expenses
by accountants, many parents, particularly women, confront child care expenses
in order to work.  Finally, the appellant's decision to have children should
not be viewed solely as a consumption, or personal, choice.  When one considers
deductibility solely with reference to ss. 9, 18(1)(a) and 18(1)(h),
child care expenses may remain difficult to classify.                     However, ss. 9,
18(1)(a) and 18(1)(h) cannot be interpreted to account for a
child care business expense deduction in light of the language used in
s. 63.  It is clear that the definition of "child care expenses"
in s. 63 specifically comprehends the purpose for which the appellant
maintains she incurred her nanny expenses.  According to part of that
definition, a child care expense is one incurred in order to provide child care
services "to enable the taxpayer . . . to carry on a business
either alone or as a partner".  Furthermore, s. 63(1)(e)
operates to cap the deduction with reference to "earned income",
which is defined to include "incomes from all businesses carried on either
alone or as a partner actively engaged in the business".   To the extent
that s. 63 intends to limit child care expense deductions to lower earning
supporters, it would substantially undermine that intent if the appellant were
allowed to take a complete deduction of the child care expenses, free from the
consideration of whether or not she is the lower earning supporter. 
Section 4(2), which provides that no deductions permitted by ss. 60
to 63 are applicable to a particular source, may be further evidence that
s. 63 is intended to be a complete legislative response to the child care
expense issue.  The proposals which led directly to the introduction of s. 63
support the view that s. 63 is such a response.  Since s. 63 eliminates
any question of ambiguity, it also eliminates the need for recourse to the
values of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  as an interpretive
aid.                     There has been no
violation of s. 15(1)  of the Charter  in this case.  Since
s. 63 constitutes a complete code with respect to child care expenses, it
is the proper focus of the Charter  argument.  The appellant has not
demonstrated a violation of s. 15(1)  of the Charter  with respect to
s. 63  as she has not proved that s. 63  draws a distinction based upon
the personal characteristic of sex.  While it is clear that women
disproportionately bear the burden of child care in society, it has not been
shown that women disproportionately incur child care expenses.  Although the
appellant has overwhelmingly demonstrated how the issue of child care
negatively affects women in employment terms, proof that women incur social
costs is not sufficient proof that they incur child care expenses.                      Child care expenses
should not be disallowed as a business expense under s. 18(1)(h) as
being personal in nature.  While for most men the responsibility of children
does not impact on the number of hours they work or affect their ability to
work, a woman's ability even to participate in the work force may be completely
contingent on her ability to acquire child care.  Many business deductions have
been permitted in the past even though these expenditures have a personal element. 
The real costs incurred by businesswomen with children are no less real, no
less worthy of consideration and no less incurred in order to gain or produce
income from business.  Finally, while there is a personal component to child
raising, this "choice" is one from which all of society benefits,
even though much of the burden remains on the shoulders of women.                     Section 63 of
the Act does not preclude the deduction of child care expenses as a business
expense.  Section 63 provides general relief to parents, but nothing in
its wording implies that deductions available under s. 9(1) are abolished
or restricted in this respect.  In providing that none of the deductions
permitted by ss. 60 to 63 are applicable to a particular source of income,
s. 4(2) clearly provides for some deductions which may legitimately fall
under two sections of the Act.  At the very least, s. 63 is ambiguous in
its effect on s. 9(1), and under the general rules of statutory
interpretation, ambiguities are to be resolved in favour of the taxpayer.  In
the absence of precise and clear wording in the Act with regard to the effect
of s. 63 on s. 9(1), general child care expenses which might be
deductible under s. 63 may coexist with child care expenses deductible as
a business expense.  To conclude that s. 63 intends to limit the
opportunity for a businesswoman to deduct child care expenses is antithetical
to the whole purpose of the legislation, which was aimed at helping working
women and their families bear the high cost of child care.  The concern that
employed persons and business people will not be treated in the same manner is
a fact which stems from the rationale of the Act itself:  business deductions
generally are restricted to those in business and are not available to an
employed person.  The fact that the government has provided that a deduction
for child care expenses be available to all parents, including employed
persons, who ordinarily enjoy very few deductions, indicates governmental
recognition that child care is a legitimate expense of working parents, in
particular mothers.  Further, since the Act either permits the deduction of
child care expenses as a business expense or is ambiguous, that ambiguity must
be examined through the prism of the values enshrined in the Charter , in
particular ss. 15  and 28 , which encompass and embrace the importance and
significance of equality between the sexes.  To disallow child care as a
business expense clearly has a differential impact on women.  Consideration of
the Charter  values when interpreting the Act thus strengthens the
conclusion that the appellant should be able to deduct her child care expenses
as a business expense.                     An interpretation
which prevents the appellant from deducting her child care expenses as a
business expense results in an infringement of her right to equality pursuant
to s. 15  of the Charter .  The appellant has proved that she
incurred an actual and calculable cost for child care and that this cost is
disproportionately borne by women.   Cases Cited  By Iacobucci J.     Statutes and

J. -- The basic issue in
this appeal is whether child care expenses, on the facts of this case, are
deductible as business expenses in the determination of profit under the Income
Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, as amended (the "Act").  I.Facts                       In her personal
income tax returns for 1982 to 1985, the appellant deducted the wages paid to
Simpson as business expenses.  In Notices of Assessment received by the
appellant in 1983 and 1984, Revenue Canada allowed the deductions.  However, in
Notices of Reassessment dated December 9, 1985 and November 7, 1986, Revenue
Canada disallowed the deductions for all four years.  The appellant objected,
but the disallowance was confirmed for the stated reason that the expenses were
not outlays or expenses incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing income
from business.  The expenses were characterized as personal or living
expenses.  In place of the disallowed deductions, Revenue Canada allowed the
appellant revised child care deductions of $1,000 for 1982, $2,000 for each of
1983 and 1984, and $4,000 for 1985, pursuant to s. 63 of the Act.                     After the
appellant's objection to, and Revenue Canada's confirmation of, the Notices of
Reassessment, the appellant successfully challenged these notices in the
Federal Court, Trial Division.  The Trial Division held that the appellant
could deduct the payments to Simpson as business expenses: [1989] 3 F.C. 59,
[1989] 1 C.T.C.  476, 89 D.T.C. 5243, 40 C.R.R. 278, 25 F.T.R. 306.  The
Minister of National Revenue appealed and, in allowing the appeal, the Federal
Court of Appeal restored the Notices of Reassessment: [1991] 3 F.C. 507, [1991]

year.                     67.  In computing income, no
deduction shall be made in respect of an outlay or expense in respect of which
any amount is otherwise deductible under this Act, except to the extent that
the outlay or expense was reasonable in the circumstances.  III.Judgments Below  A.Federal Court, Trial Division,
[1989] 3 F.C. 59 (Cullen J.)                     1.Child Care as a Business
Expense                     Dealing first with
issues of statutory interpretation, Cullen J. noted that "[t]he
determination of profit and the question of whether an expenditure is a proper
business expense to be included in the calculation of profit are questions of
law"  (p. 66).  Based upon his review of case law, he then held that,
in determining what constitutes a legitimate business expense, the proper
approach is to "ascertain whether the expense or disbursement was
consistent with ordinary principles of commercial trading or well accepted
principles of business practice" (pp. 66-67).  For Cullen J. (at p.
67), a "business test" was to be applied in order to determine the
legal meaning of "profit".                     In addition to
satisfying a business test, Cullen J. noted that a business expense must be
made or incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing income from the
business in order to satisfy s. 18(1)(a) of the Act.  He
reviewed several cases which have interpreted this requirement, before
suggesting (at p. 71) that courts have given a "progressive
interpretation" to s. 18(1)(a).  For Cullen J., the concept of
a business expense has been "adapted to reflect the changing ways of doing
business" (p. 71).                       In the result,
Cullen J. was satisfied that the taxpayer had used good business and
commercial judgment in dedicating part of her resources from the practice of
law to the provision of child care.  He stated (at p. 73):  This
decision was acceptable according to business principles which include the
development of intellectual capital, the improvement of productivity, the
provision of services to clients and making available the resource which she
sells, namely her time.                      Having thus found
that the nanny expenses satisfied ss. 9 and 18(1)(a), Cullen J.
examined whether s. 18(1)(h) prohibited their deduction as personal
or living expenses.  On this question, he stated that, on the facts of the
case, "a distinction has been made between child care which allows one to
participate in the economy and generate income and child care which allows one
to go out on social occasions" (p. 74).  According to Cullen J.,
only the latter are discretionary personal living expenses.  Cullen J.
distinguished the appellant's child care expenses from other expenses which
might be characterized as personal or living expenses, principally because of
the appellant's legal obligation to care for her children.                     For these reasons,
as a matter of statutory interpretation, and based upon the facts of the case,
Cullen J. concluded that the nanny expenses qualified as business expenses
deductible in the computation of a taxpayer's profit.  It is noteworthy that in
so doing, Cullen J. stated the following (at p. 75):  "With
respect to section 63 of the Act, I would like to note at this point in my
reasons that the defendant has admitted that if the nanny expense is a proper
business expense pursuant to sections 3, 9 and 18 of the Act, then
section 63 cannot prevent it from being allowed as such".  Finally,
Cullen J. quickly indicated that there was no question as to the
reasonableness of the sums expended within the meaning of s. 67 of the Act.  2.Section
15(1)  of the Charter                     Despite his
conclusions on the interpretive issue, Cullen J. considered the taxpayer's Charter 
argument in the alternative.  He recognized that, since s. 15(1)  did not
come into effect until April 17, 1985, and since that section does not operate
retrospectively, the taxpayer could not make a Charter  claim respecting
child care expenses incurred prior to the section's coming into force.                     Cullen J. quoted
extensively from the decision of this Court in Andrews v. Law Society of
British Columbia, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 143, and relied heavily upon principles
stated therein, in discussing s. 15.  First, he noted that since he was
considering an Act of Parliament, s. 15 was applicable.  Second, he looked
for unequal treatment and discrimination.  Although his analysis is undoubtedly
intended to consider these latter two concepts with respect to the Act
itself, I note that Cullen J. focused upon Revenue Canada's treatment of
the taxpayer.                     On the question of
unequal treatment, Cullen J. first looked for and found a distinction (at
p. 80):  "by refusing the plaintiff her deduction, the MNR is
treating her differently from other taxpayers with expenses that are considered
necessary to generate business income".   On the question of
discrimination, Cullen J. characterized the Act as facially neutral, but
held that there was an adverse impact upon the taxpayer, in so far as she was
compelled to pay more taxes and take on extra paper work by virtue of the
unequal treatment.  Viewed another way, he held that the taxpayer was
"denied the benefit of a tax deduction" (p. 82).  Cullen J. tied
the discrimination to the "personal characteristics of sex and family or
parental status" (p. 84).                      Since Cullen J.
found that there was no evidence indicating that Parliament had made a
legislative choice against full deductibility of child care expenses, he
indicated (at p. 87) that courts are left to determine, in accordance with the Charter ,
"whether the concepts of profit and business expenses" permit
deductibility.  Upon this basis, he concluded that ss. 9 and 18(1)(a)
permit the deduction of child care expenses as business expenses.  This
conclusion was an interpretive one said to be "consistent with the
requirements of the Charter ", and which involved no questions of
"`deleting', `amending' or `reading in'" (p. 87).                     In the result,
Cullen J. held that the taxpayer was allowed to deduct the payments made to
Simpson as a business expense for taxation years 1982, 1983, 1984, and 1985. 
This conclusion rested solely upon his approach to statutory interpretation. 
With respect to his alternative conclusion involving Charter  analysis,
Cullen J. held that these payments were deductible for 1985 and subsequent
taxation years.  B.Federal Court of Appeal, [1991] 3 F.C.
507 (Décary J.A., Pratte and MacGuigan JJ.A. concurring)                     After reviewing the
facts of the case, Décary J.A. established a context for the decision of the
Federal Court of Appeal.  He discussed the fiscal history of child care
expenses, and particularly s. 63 of the Act, citing a royal
commission report and a government white paper.  With reference to Hansard, he
sought to describe government policy on child care expenses.  Finally, he noted
various reports and background papers dealing with child care responses which
had been cited to the court.                     1.Child
Care as a Business Expense                     As a first point of
analysis, Décary J.A. discussed s. 18(1)(a) of the Act. 
With respect to the argument that the taxpayer's child care expenses were made
in the ordinary course of business or as part of the income earning process, he
characterized her legal obligation to care for her children as an obligation
independent of her business.  For him, the child care obligation is imposed
upon both parents, and is, in any event, a "natural obligation"
(p. 522).                     It is not obvious
whether Décary J.A. accepted or rejected the taxpayer's arguments with respect
to the proper tests to be applied under ss. 9(1) and 18(1)(a) of
the Act.  It is clear, however, that he professed to agree with the
taxpayer and the trial judge to the effect that judicial interpretation
"must be sufficiently flexible and sensitive to adapt to changing
circumstances" (p. 523).  Equally, he stated that "concepts
should be extended by the courts in order to take into account the presence of
women in the business world" (p. 523).  But then he summarized his
overall disagreement with the taxpayer and the court below with respect to the
proper interpretation of the Act.  He stated (at p. 523) that:  ... the concept of a business expense has been
developed exclusively in relation to the commercial needs of the business,
without any regard to the particular needs of those in charge of the business,
and I have difficulty in seeing how a change in the particular needs of these
persons could justify modifying an interpretation which has nothing to do with
these needs.  Having said that, I consider that the case at bar does not
require a conclusion on this point for the simple reason that Parliament has
itself already amended the Income Tax Act to provide for the specific
situation relied on by the respondent.                     In support of this
conclusion, Décary J.A. examined the language of s. 63.  His examination
caused him to conclude that s. 63 was clearly intended by Parliament to
apply to "a parent carrying on a business and income earned by the parent
from the operation of a business" (p. 525).  For this reason, he
located child care expenses solely with s. 63 of the Act, excluding
such expenses from the concept of "business expenses" implicit within
s. 18(1)(a).  He did not otherwise examine the meaning of
"profit" in s. 9 of the Act.                     2.  Section
15 (1)  of the Charter                     Décary J.A. began
his Charter  analysis by summarizing the taxpayer's basic Charter 
argument.  He noted that a s. 15(1)  violation was alleged, not with
respect to the actual language of the Act, but with respect to any
interpretation of the Act's language which could prevent child care
expenses from being deducted as business expenses.  He then suggested that the
taxpayer supported her argument by reference to the decisions of this Court in Slaight
Communications Inc. v. Davidson, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1038, and Hills v.
Canada (Attorney General), [1988] 1 S.C.R. 513.  Since Décary J.A. quoted
from these decisions in a manner which suggests that he was considering the
extent to which Charter  values should infuse ordinary statutory
interpretation, it is somewhat unclear to me whether some of his subsequent
comments are intended to relate to this kind of statutory interpretation, or to
Charter  analysis per se.                     In either event,
Décary J.A. went on to make general statements with respect to the propriety of
challenging what can be loosely called "socioeconomic legislation"
with the Charter .  After quoting from several decisions, he cited Ontario
Public Service Employees Union v. National Citizens Coalition Inc. (1987),
60 O.R. (2d) 26 (H.C.), and in apparent reliance upon language used in that case,
stated that "[a]t bottom, the approach put forward by the respondent risks
trivializing the Charter " (p. 528).  To accept the taxpayer's
arguments would, according to him, "be to fall into the trap of
overshooting against which the Supreme Court of Canada has constantly warned
the courts" (p. 529).  Décary J.A. recoiled from the idea that the
taxpayer could use s. 15  of the Charter  to obtain a positive
guarantee of equality, one which would compel "legislatures to adopt
measures enabling... her to work" (p. 530).                       The court allowed
the appeal, restored the Notices of Assessment, and ordered the appellant to
pay the respondent's costs at trial and on appeal.  IV.Issues                     On July 14, 1992,
the Chief Justice stated the following constitutional questions:  1.  
If ss. 9, 18 and 63 of the Income Tax Act are not open to an
interpretation other than that full child care expenses of the appellant are
not deductible as business expenses, does any part, or do any or all of these
sections, infringe or deny rights guaranteed by s. 15  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?  2.   To the extent that the above
sections of the Income Tax Act infringe or deny the rights and freedoms
guaranteed by s. 15  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ,
are these sections justified by s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms  and therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?                     In responding to
these constitutional questions, I will structure my discussion with reference
to the following principal issues:  1.  Are
child care expenses deductible as part of the determination of profit under
s. 9(1) of the Act?  2.  If
child care expenses are not deductible as part of the determination of profit
under s. 9(1) of the Act, has there been a violation of
s. 15(1)  of the Charter ?  3.  If
there has been a violation of s. 15(1)  of the Charter , is it
justified under s. 1 ?  V.Analysis  1.Are
child care expenses deductible as part of the determination of profit under
s. 9(1) of the Act?                     There are two
aspects to this question:  (a) Are child care expenses deductible under
principles of income tax law applicable to business deductions?  (b)  If child
care expenses are not otherwise deductible using such principles, are they
deductible employing the values of the Charter  as an interpretive aid? 
For the following reasons, I am of the opinion that both of these questions
must be answered in the negative.  (a)Are
child care expenses deductible under principles of income tax law applicable to
business deductions?                     My analysis of
income tax law principles applicable to business deductions will proceed in the
following way.  Immediately below, I will describe the statutory framework
which supports business expense deductibility.  Then, I will examine
deductibility issues per se under four headings.  Under the first, I
will discuss the interrelationship of ss. 9(1), 18(1)(a) and 18(1)(h)
of the Act, in order to clarify the proper analytical approach in this
case.  Under the second, I will comment upon the historical classification of
child care expenses as personal expenses, in order to define the relevance of
s. 18(1)(h) of the Act.  Under the third, I will examine
s. 18(1)(a) of the Act in a search for indicia of business
expenses which can be compared to the facts of this case.  Finally, under the
fourth, I will consider the relevance of the child care expense deduction in
s. 63 of the Act.                     At the outset,
however, it is helpful to describe briefly the statutory framework in which the
subsequent analysis will take place.  Canadian residents pay tax pursuant to
the basic charging provision, s. 2(1) of the Act.  Therein, the
taxability of residents is established and made referable to the concept of
"taxable income".  As set out in s. 2(2), calculation of a
taxpayer's "taxable income" first involves determining the taxpayer's
"income for the year".  That concept, in turn, requires recourse to
s. 3 of the Act, where, in part, it is established that to
determine a taxpayer's income for a taxation year requires first that one
compute the taxpayer's income from each of several sources.  As set out in
s. 3(a), one such source is "income ... from ... business".   (i)Business
Income:  The Interrelationship of ss. 9(1), 18(1)(a) and 18(1)(h)                     Leaving aside for
the moment the potential impact of s. 63, three provisions of the Act
which deal with business income determination are relevant in this case, and
the language of each is worthy of note.  First, by virtue of s. 9(1), a
taxpayer's income from business is stated to be the taxpayer's "profit
therefrom for the year", "profit" being nowhere defined in the Act. 
Second, s. 18(1)(a) provides that in computing business income, no
deduction shall be made for an expense "except to the extent that it was
made or incurred by the taxpayer for the purpose of gaining or producing
income".  Finally, in s. 18(1)(h), a prohibition against
deducting "personal or living expenses" is established.  The proper
approach to these three provisions is the initial point to be examined.                     At one time, it was
not clearly understood whether the authority for deducting business
expenses was located within what is now s. 9(1) or within what is now
s. 18(1)(a).  In a series of decisions culminating in Royal
Trust Co. v. Minister of National Revenue, 57 D.T.C. 1055 (Ex. Ct.),
however, Thorson P. recognized that the deduction of business expenses is a
necessary part of the s. 9(1) "profit" calculation.  In Daley
v. Minister of National Revenue, [1950] Ex. C.R. 516, Thorson P. commented
upon s. 3 (the forerunner to s. 9) and s. 6(a) (the
forerunner to s. 18(1)(a)) of the Income War Tax Act, R.S.C.
1927, c. 97, in the following terms (at p. 521):  The
correct view, in my opinion, is that the deductibility of the disbursements and
expenses that may properly be deducted "in computing the amount of the
profits or gains to be assessed" is inherent in the concept of
"annual net profit or gain" in the definition of taxable income
contained in section 3.  The deductibility from the receipts of a taxation year
of the appropriate disbursements or expenses stems, therefore, from section 3
of the Act, if it stems from any section, and not at all, even inferentially,
from paragraph (a) of section 6.  In other words, the "profit"
concept in s. 9(1) is inherently a net concept which presupposes
business expense deductions.  It is now generally accepted that it is
s. 9(1) which authorizes the deduction of business expenses; the
provisions of s. 18(1) are limiting provisions only.  See The Queen v.
MerBan Capital Corp., 89 D.T.C. 5404 (F.C.A.).                      Under s. 9(1),
deductibility is ordinarily considered as it was by Thorson P. in Royal
Trust, supra (at p. 1059):  ...
the first approach to the question whether a particular disbursement or expense
was deductible for income tax purpose was to ascertain whether its deduction
was consistent with ordinary principles of commercial trading or well
accepted principles of business ... practice ... [Emphasis added.]  Thus, in a deductibility analysis,
one's first recourse is to s. 9(1), a section which embodies, as the trial
judge suggested, a form of "business test" for taxable profit.                     This is a test
which has been variously phrased.  As the trial judge rightly noted, the
determination of profit under s. 9(1) is a question of law:  Neonex
International Ltd. v. The Queen, [1978] C.T.C. 485 (F.C.A.).  Perhaps for
this reason, and as Neonex itself impliedly suggests, courts have been
reluctant to posit a s. 9(1) test based upon "generally accepted
accounting principles" (G.A.A.P.):  see also "Business Income and
Taxable Income" (1953 Conference Report:  Canadian Tax Foundation) cited
in B. J. Arnold and T. W. Edgar, eds., Materials on Canadian Income Tax
(9th ed. 1990), at p. 336.  Any reference to G.A.A.P. connotes a degree of
control by professional accountants which is inconsistent with a legal
test for "profit" under s. 9(1).  Further, whereas an accountant
questioning the propriety of a deduction may be motivated by a desire to
present an appropriately conservative picture of current profitability, the Act
is motivated by a different purpose:  the raising of public revenues.  For
these reasons, it is more appropriate in considering the s. 9(1) business
test to speak of "well accepted principles of business (or accounting)
practice" or "well accepted principles of commercial trading".                      Although
ss. 18(1)(a) and (h) may, therefore, simply be analytically
repetitive or confirmatory of prohibitions already embodied in s. 9(1), they
may serve to reinforce the point already made, namely, that the s. 9(1)
test is a legal test rather than an accountancy test.  At the same time, they
conveniently summarize what might otherwise be abstract principles of commercial
practice.  As noted by D. Ish, J. A. Rendall and C. A. Brown
("Deductions" in Materials on Canadian Income Tax, supra,
at pp. 387-88):  ...
the frequency with which paragraph 18(1)(a) appears in the cases confirms that
it is useful, if not necessary, for the Minister to have specific statements
which can be relied upon....  Arguably, paragraph 18(1)(h) is just a refinement
of paragraph 18(1)(a); indeed, one might suppose that the taxpayer's personal
or living expenses would not be deducted according to standard practices of
accounting for business profits, the test erected by subsection 9(1).  The
process we are describing is one in which the focus is progressively narrowed. 
Although a personal or living expense prohibited by paragraph 18(1)(h) arguably
would also be prohibited by paragraph 18(1)(a) ... the Minister may
nevertheless find it very useful to concentrate attention on the specific
characterization of a disputed expense as being of a personal consumption
nature.                     There is no doubt
that, in some cases, s. 9(1) will operate in isolation to scrutinize
deductions according to well accepted principles of business practice.  In this
respect, I refer to cases, also noted by the trial judge, in which the real
issue was whether a particular method of accounting could be used to escape tax
liability:  e.g. Associated Investors of Canada Ltd. v. Minister of National
Revenue, [1967] 2 Ex. C.R. 96; Canadian General Electric Co. v. Minister
of National Revenue, [1962] S.C.R. 3.  In other cases, including the
present case, however, the real issue may be whether a deduction is prohibited
by well accepted principles of business practice for the reason that it
is not incurred for the purpose of earning income, or for the reason
that it is a personal or living expense.  In such cases, any treatment of the
issue will necessarily blur s. 9(1) with ss. 18(1)(a) and (h).                     I proceed,
therefore, to deal with closely related arguments respecting the specific
language of ss. 18(1)(a) and 18(1)(h).  In so doing, I mean
to cast no doubt upon the proposition that s. 9(1) contains the authority
for deduction, nor do I wish to suggest that s. 9(1) is not the first
section against which a deduction is to be measured.  Instead, I simply wish to
acknowledge that, on the facts of this case, I cannot respond to the arguments
of the parties without necessarily addressing the general language of
s. 9(1), and the specific language of ss. 18(1)(a) and 18(1)(h),
at the same time.  (ii)Personal Expenses and s. 18(1)(h)                     I begin with
s. 18(1)(h), since traditional tax analysis characterized child
care expenses as personal expenses, such that in modern terms, s. 18(1)(h)
would operate to specifically prohibit them.  I do not propose to review the
numerous cases which might be cited to demonstrate this point:  see B.
J. Arnold, "The Deduction for Child Care Expenses in the United
States and Canada:  A Comparative Analysis" (1973), 12 West. Ont. L.
Rev. 1, at p. 27, footnote 141; J. E. Hershfield, "Recent Trends
in the Deduction of Expenses in Computing Income", in 1989 Conference
Report (Canadian Tax Foundation), at p. 44:2, footnote 3.  It is sufficient
to note, as did the trial judge below, that the line of reasoning supporting
such a characterization is ultimately founded upon the English decision of Bowers
v. Harding, supra, and brief examination of that case can help to
explain the historical classification of child care expenses as personal
expenses.                     In Bowers v. Harding,
the Hardings (a married couple) were employed in the operation of a school, and
they received a joint salary for this employment.  Mr. Harding engaged a
household servant, according to the admitted facts of the case, in order
"to enable his wife to have time to perform her duties as
schoolmistress" (p. 23).  Since the relevant tax legislation treated
the couple's joint salary as Mr. Harding's alone, he sought to deduct the
expense of the housekeeper upon the basis that it was incurred "wholly,
exclusively, and necessarily in the performance of the duties of his ...
employment":  Income Tax Act (U.K.), 16 & 17 Vict., c. 34,
s. 51.                     The attempted
deduction was disallowed.  In the eyes of the court, the Hardings were
proposing a "but for" test for deductibility.  In other words, they
were arguing that "but for the housekeeper", the income could not
have been earned.  Baron Pollock rejected this test in the following terms (at
p. 26):  When
a man and his wife accept an office there are certain detriments as well as
profits, but is in no sense an expenditure which enables them to earn the
income in the sense of its being money expended upon goods, or in the payment
of clerks, whereby a tradesman or a merchant is enabled to earn an income....
If we were to go into these questions with great nicety we must consider the
district in which the person lives, the altitude at which he lives, the price
of meat, and the character of the clothing that he would require, in many
places indeed the character of the services and the wages paid to particular
servants, and the style in which each person lives, before we could come to any
conclusion.                     I am aware
that many people might question the applicability of the language and
circumstances of Bowers v. Harding, supra.  Indeed, there are
many ways that it might be distinguished.  First, it deals with income from
employment, rather than with income from business.  Second, the expense in
question related to "housekeeping", rather than to child care (or, at
least, if child care was involved, the case report fails to disclose so). 
Third, the expense was compared against the very strict requirement that it be made
"wholly, exclusively and necessarily" for the purpose of earning the
income, and no identical requirement arises on the facts of this case. 
Finally, perhaps, like the trial judge below, one could merely focus upon the
fact that the case came from "another age" and from "another
system" (p. 72).                     Even without
distinguishing Bowers v. Harding in this fashion, however, I
believe that I should move beyond s. 18(1)(h) of the Act and
the traditional classification of child care in the analysis of whether child
care expenses are truly personal in nature.  The relationship between expenses
and income in Bowers v. Harding was subsumed in that case, as it was in
cases to follow, within an apparent dichotomy.  As stated by Professor Arnold,
in "The Deduction for Child Care Expenses", supra, at
p. 27:   There are obvious tautologies within
this approach.  "Personal expenses" are said to arise from
"personal circumstances", and "business expenses" are said
to arise from "business circumstances".  But, how is one to locate a
particular expense within the business/personal dichotomy?                     This appeal
presents a particular expense which has been traditionally characterized as
personal in nature.  If, in coming to a decision, this Court stated that since
such expenses have always been personal, they must now be personal, the
conclusion could be easily and deservedly attacked.  For this reason, proper
analysis of this question demands that the relationship between child care
expenses and business income be examined more critically, in order to determine
whether that relationship can be sufficient to justify the former's
deductibility.  This proposition, in my opinion, leads naturally to s. 18(1)(a),
which sets out the relationship required by the Act.       Judges
can and should adapt the common law to reflect the changing social, moral and
economic fabric of the country.  Judges should not be quick to perpetuate rules
whose social foundation has long since disappeared.  Nonetheless, there are
significant constraints on the power of the judiciary to change the law.... The
judiciary should confine itself to those incremental changes which are
necessary to keep the common law in step with the dynamic and evolving fabric
of our society.  The increased participation of women
in the Canadian workforce is undoubtedly a change in the "social
foundation" within the meaning of Salituro.  Accordingly, I do not
feel that I must slavishly follow those cases which have characterized child
care expenses as personal in nature.  It now falls to be considered whether the
alternative is appropriate.  In other words, are child care expenses not
prohibited by s. 18(1)(a) of the Act?  (iii)Business
Expenses and s. 18(1)(a)                     In order to be
deductible as business expenses, the appellant's child care expenses must have
been incurred "for the purpose of gaining or producing income from the
business" within the meaning of s. 18(1)(a) of the Act. 
This is not to say that the expenses must directly lead to the production of
income.  Even with respect to the more restrictively worded ancestor of
s. 18(1)(a), it was recognized in Imperial Oil Ltd. v. Minister
of National Revenue, [1947] C.T.C. 353 (Ex. Ct.), at p. 371, that it
is not necessary to prove a causative relationship between a particular expense
and a particular receipt.  Indeed, provided that an expense otherwise satisfies
s. 18(1)(a), an expense may be deductible even if it results in a
loss.                     There is some
difficulty associated with determining how an expense can otherwise satisfy
s. 18(1)(a), however.  Several cases which gave important
consideration to the question did so with respect to the more restrictive
language of the Income War Tax Act, s. 6(a).  That section
prohibited the deduction of expenses to the extent that they were not "wholly,
exclusively and necessarily laid out or expended for the purpose of earning
the income" (emphasis added).                      Dominion Natural
Gas thus established
a test for business expenses frequently referred to as the "income earning
process" test.  In subsequent cases, this test was applied by courts, but
not always in a manner which suggests that the application was
straightforward.  In Kellogg Co. of Canada Ltd. v. Minister of National
Revenue, [1942] C.T.C. 51 (Ex. Ct.), for example, Kellogg incurred
substantial legal expenses in the defence of an action alleging a trademark
infringement.  Notwithstanding Dominion, Maclean J. in Kellogg
held that such expenses were currently deductible as business expenses. 
Maclean J. focused upon the fact that Kellogg's legal expenses were
involuntary, the action not having been commenced by the taxpayer, and seemed
to disregard the fact that the same was true of the legal expenses in Dominion. 
A similar discomfort can be discerned within Imperial Oil, supra,
and Hudson's Bay Co. v. Minister of National Revenue, [1947] C.T.C. 86
(Ex. Ct.): see Brooks, supra, at p. 255.                     In 1948, the
statutory language which governed in the above cases was replaced by the
immediate forerunner of s. 18(1)(a):  The Income Tax Act,
S.C. 1948, c. 52, s. 12(1)(a).  It is important to highlight
the changes which were thus introduced.  First, whereas the old provision
required that an expense be incurred "wholly, exclusively and
necessarily" for the stated purpose, the current provision does not relate
the purpose requirement to any modifier.  Second, whereas the old provision
stated that a business expense was an expense incurred for the "purpose of
earning the income", the current provision speaks of "gaining
or producing" the income.                     On
more than one occasion since the amendment, it has been recognized that the
current language of the Act suggests a broader rationale for deductibility
than did the former.  In Premium Iron Ores Ltd. v. Minister of National
Revenue, [1966] S.C.R. 685, a taxpayer incurred substantial legal expenses
in resisting the tax claim of a foreign jurisdiction.  In discussing the
deductibility of such expenses, Martland J. suggested that "[i]t seems
clear that the present wording of [s. 18(1)(a)] ... was intended to
broaden the definition of deductible expenses" (p. 702).  See also
Hall J. at p. 711; Royal Trust, supra, at p. 1059.  The
Court in Premium found such expenses to be currently deductible, and
rejected that operations should be "segregated into revenue producing as
distinct from revenue retaining functions" (p. 711, per Hall
J.).                     In considering the
extent to which these cases, and others cited by the trial judge, demonstrate a
liberalization of principles of deduction with respect to s. 18(1)(a)
of the Act,  it is relevant to acknowledge their historical context.  In
particular, I note that since the cases discussed above were decided prior to
1972, they arose in the context of a taxation system which did not allow
deductions in respect of intangible capital expenditures.  For this reason,
when confronted with an expenditure for intangibles, courts had two choices. 
First, the expenditure could be characterized as being on account of capital,
in which case it could not be deducted at all since capital expenditures could
only be deducted within the capital cost allowance system, a system which
provides only for the depreciation of tangible property:  see Income
Tax Regulations, C.R.C. 1978, c. 945, Schedule II, Class 8(i). 
Second, an intangible expenditure could be characterized as a current
expenditure, in which case it would be totally deductible as such.   Courts,
recognizing the adverse effect of such a characterization, attempted to
circumvent the paragraph 18(1)(b) prohibition by stretching the definition of a
current deductible business expense.  In other words, it is true that the
courts have expanded the ambit of deductibility, but it does not necessarily
follow that the next step is to make child care expenses deductible.  Today, the treatment of business
deductions occurs in a statutory environment which provides for capital
intangibles through the concept of eligible capital expenditures:  see
ss. 14 and 20(1)(b) of the Act.                      All of these tests
include some reference to the purpose of an expense.  In considering the
extent to which a purpose test is appropriate, I wish to make note of the
decision of Wilson J. in Mattabi Mines Ltd. v. Ontario (Minister of Revenue),
[1988] 2 S.C.R. 175.  Therein, Wilson J. considered a taxation provision
substantially similar to s. 18(1)(a), she examined jurisprudence on
s. 18(1)(a), and she came to the following conclusion (at
p. 189):  The
only thing that matters is that the expenditures were a legitimate expense made
in the ordinary course of business with the intention that the company could
generate a taxable income some time in the future.                      The appropriateness
of a purpose test must also be measured against other tests which have been
proposed in this case.  The respondent in this Court, as in the courts below,
argued in favour of what can be called an "income-producing circle"
test.  According to such a test, a distinction should be made between expenses
incurred in order to approach the income-producing circle (such as clothing and
commuting expenses, for example), and those which are incurred within the
circle itself.  Of course, the test would presuppose that only the latter would
be deductible as business expenses.                      In my view, the
test has a second problem:  it conjures up an image of an income-producing
circle which is entirely separate and apart from a domestic circle.  Taking
commuting expenses as an example, one tends to imagine a taxpayer leaving the
"home circle" and incurring expenses in order to approach the
"income-producing circle".  This is a simplistic vision of the modern
business world.  One need only consider the deduction available for the home
office (s. 18(12) of the Act) to realize that a taxpayer's personal
and business activities may be closely related within the taxpayer's home
itself.  Further, to the extent that this Court is now asked to consider
whether the needs of women have been disregarded in the definition of
"business expenses", it is misleading to presuppose that activities
occurring within the domestic environment are, for that reason alone, more
likely to be excluded from the income-producing circle, since the concerns of
women have been confined to the domestic environment as an historical matter.                      Concepts such as
the "income-producing circle" or the "trade/trader"
distinction suggest that the classification of an expense involves a
straightforward question.  For example, these concepts ask:  Does the expense
satisfy a need of the business or a need of the taxpayer?  Without meaning to
retract the critique of these concepts just offered, I frankly acknowledge that
such a question is often sufficient when one classifies expenses. 
However, I do not regard this question as necessarily sufficient in cases, such
as the present case, which involve the allegation that an expense is a
"personal expense".  In other words, there are a great many expenses
which are never alleged to be "personal expenses" at all.  With
respect to these, the approach is ordinarily much more objective, and the
analysis is generally confined to s. 9 of the Act.  It is only when an
expense is alleged to be a "personal expense" that one must go
further and ask what is meant by the concept of "business need".                     Upon reflection,
therefore, no test has been proposed which improves upon or which substantially
modifies a test derived directly from the language of s. 18(1)(a). 
The analytical trail leads back to its source, and I simply ask the following: 
did the appellant incur child care expenses for the purpose of gaining or
producing income from a business?                      It may
be relevant in a particular case to consider whether a deduction is ordinarily
allowed as a business expense by accountants.  This is not to revert to the
notion that accountancy will govern under s. 9(1) of the Act, since
accountants "have no special expertise in making" the business versus
personal expense judgment (Brooks, supra, at p. 256).  Instead,
such evidence may simply indicate that a particular kind of expenditure is
widely accepted as a business expense.  Similarly, it may be relevant to
consider whether the expense is one normally incurred by others involved in the
taxpayer's business.  If it is, there may be an increased likelihood that the
expense is a business expense.                     It may also be
relevant to consider whether a particular expense would have been incurred if
the taxpayer was not engaged in the pursuit of business income.  Professor
Brooks comments upon this consideration in the following terms (at
p. 258):                      I recognize that in
discussing food, clothing and shelter, I am adverting to a "but for"
test opposite to the one discussed earlier.  Here, the test suggests that
"but for the gaining or producing of income, these expenses would still
need to be incurred".  I must acknowledge that because it is a "but
for" test, it can be manipulated.  One can argue, for example, that
"but for work, the taxpayer would not still require expensive
dress clothes".  However, in most cases, the manipulation can be
easily rejected.  Continuing with the same example, one can conclude that the
expense of clothing does "not increase significantly" (Brooks, supra,
at p. 258) in tax terms when one upgrades a wardrobe.  Alternatively, one
can focus upon the change in clothing as a personal choice.  Or, finally,
considering that all psychic satisfactions represent a form of consumption
within the ideal of a comprehensive tax base, one can focus upon the increased
personal satisfaction associated with possessing a fine wardrobe.                     Taking up this last
point, I note that in a tax system which is at least partly geared toward the
preservation of vertical and horizontal equities ("[h]orizontal equity
merely requires that `equals' be treated equally, with the term `equals' 
referring to equality of ability to pay" and "vertical equity merely
requires that the incidence of the tax burden should be more heavily borne by
the rich than the poor":  V. Krishna, "Perspectives on Tax
Policy" in Essays on Canadian Taxation, supra, at pp. 5 and
6-7), one seeks to prevent deductions which represent personal consumption.  To
the extent that a taxpayer can make a lifestyle choice while maintaining the
same capacity to gain or produce income, such choices tend to be seen as personal
consumption decisions, and the resultant expenses as personal expenses. 
Professor Brooks gives the example of commuting expenses, which necessarily
vary according to where one chooses to live (assuming, of course, that the
taxpayer has some choice in this regard).  In some cases, it may be helpful to
analyze expenses in these terms.                     Since I have
commented upon the underlying concept of the "business need" above,
it may also be helpful to discuss the factors relevant to expense
classification in need-based terms.  In particular, it may be helpful to resort
to a "but for" test applied not to the expense but to the need which
the expense meets.  Would the need exist apart from the business?  If a need
exists even in the absence of business activity, and irrespective of whether
the need was or might have been satisfied by an expenditure to a third party or
by the opportunity cost of personal labour, then an expense to meet the need
would traditionally be viewed as a personal expense.  Expenses which can be
identified in this way are expenses which are incurred by a taxpayer in order
to relieve the taxpayer from personal duties and to make the taxpayer available
to the business.  Traditionally, expenses that simply make the taxpayer
available to the business are not considered business expenses since the
taxpayer is expected to be available to the business as a quid pro quo
for business income received.  This translates into the fundamental distinction
often drawn between the earning or source of income on the one hand, and the
receipt or use of income on the other hand.                     It remains to
consider the appellant's child care expenses in light of this discussion. 
First, it is clear on the facts that the appellant would not have incurred
child care expenses except for her business.  It is relevant to note in this
regard that her choice of child care was tailored to her business needs.  As a
lawyer, she could not personally care for her children during the day since to
do so would interfere with client meetings and court appearances, nor could she
make use of institutionalized daycare, in light of her working hours.  These
are points which were recognized by the trial judge.                     Second, however, it
is equally clear that the need which is met by child care expenses on the facts
of this case, namely, the care of the appellant's children, exists regardless
of the appellant's business activity.  The expenses were incurred to make her
available to practise her profession rather than for any other purpose
associated with the business itself.                      Finally, as a
fourth point of analysis, I am uncomfortable with the suggestion that the
appellant's decision to have children should be viewed solely as a consumption
choice.  I frankly admit that there is an element of public policy which feeds
my discomfort.  In Brooks v. Canada Safeway Ltd., [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1219,
Dickson C.J. stated (at p. 1243):  That
those who bear children and benefit society as a whole thereby should not be
economically or socially disadvantaged seems to bespeak the obvious.  It is
only women who bear children; no man can become pregnant ... it is unfair to
impose all of the costs of pregnancy upon one half of the population.    The
child care deduction was somewhat different because of the legal obligation to
care for children.  No one would suggest that the costs of caring for a pet
elephant are deductible, simply because it is impossible to go to work and
leave the elephant alone.  What made child care different was that a parent,
after making the quintessential personal choice to have a child, could not undo
that decision by giving the child to the local zoo.  This difference, however,
is not sufficient to convert child care into a business expense....                      The factors so far
analyzed suggest that, considering only ss. 9, 18(1)(a) and 18(1)(h),
arguments can be made for and against the classification of the appellant's
child care expenses as business expenses.  In another case, the arguments might
be differently balanced, since the existence of a business purpose within the
meaning of s. 18(1)(a) is a question of fact, and that the relative
weight to be given to the factors analyzed will vary from case to case. 
However, in general terms, I am of the view that child care expenses are
unique:  expenditures for child care can represent a significant percentage of
taxpayer income, such expenditures are generally linked to the taxpayer's
ability to gain or produce income, yet such expenditures are also
made in order to make a taxpayer available to the business, and the
expenditures are incurred as part of the development of another human life.  It
can be difficult to weigh the personal and business elements at play.                     In this respect,
Professor Arnold analyzed the nature of child care expenses soon after
s. 63 was introduced into the Act.  After addressing the extent to
which Canadian courts have rationalized the personal versus business expense
distinction generally, he makes the following statement (supra, at
p. 39):                     This
analysis leads one to the conclusion that the distinction between personal and
business expenses does not provide a satisfactory rationale for the treatment
of child care expenses.  Child care expenses are characterized by personal
elements but they also have significant business elements which distinguish
them from the "purely" personal expenses.  I agree with this statement, in so far
as it recognizes that when one considers deductibility solely with reference to
ss. 9, 18(1)(a) and 18(1)(h), child care expenses may remain
difficult to classify.                     I am aware that if
I were compelled to reach a conclusion with respect to the proper
classification of child care expenses with reference to only ss. 9, 18(1)(a)
and 18(1)(h) of the Act, such a conclusion would involve
competing policy considerations.  On the one hand, there is value in the
traditional tax law test which seeks to identify those expenses which simply
make a taxpayer available to the business, and which proceeds to classify such
expenses as "personal" for the reason that a "personal
need" is being fulfilled.  On the other hand, however, it is inappropriate
to disregard lightly the policy considerations which suggest that choice and
consumption have no role to play in the classification of child care expenses.                     In the Federal
Court of Appeal, a needs-based analysis carried the day.  The court concluded
that "the concept of a business expense has been developed exclusively in
relation to the commercial needs of the business, without any regard to the
particular needs of those in charge" (p. 523).  If other policy
considerations are disregarded, an availability analysis virtually compels this
conclusion.  In this regard, however, I find interesting the comments of
Professor Macklin which relate to the conclusion of the Federal Court of Appeal
just quoted (A. Macklin, "Symes v. M.N.R.:  Where Sex Meets
Class" (1992), 5 C.J.W.L. 498, at pp. 507-8):                     This
assertion failed to acknowledge that as long as business has been the exclusive
domain of men, the commercial needs of business have been dictated by what men
(think they) need to expend in order to produce income.  The fact that these
expenditures also have a "personal" element was never treated as a
complete bar.... It seems closer to the truth to suggest that these practices
inhere in the way men, or some men, engage in business.  Of course, since men
have (until very recently) been the only people engaging in business, it is
easy enough to conflate the needs of businessmen with the needs of business. 
Women's needs in doing business will necessarily be different, and one might
reasonably demand a reconceptualization of "business expenses" that
reflects the changing composition of the business class.                     Although I wish to
make no comment about expenses which have a "personal" element but
which are nonetheless currently treated as business expenses, and although
Professor Macklin fails to note the role of taxpayer availability in her
discussion of "needs", it is difficult to argue that history has not
conflated the "needs of businessmen with the needs of business" as
Professor Macklin suggests.  Therefore, to the extent that traditional income
tax law would classify child care expenses as "personal" simply
because such expenses are incurred in order to make the taxpayer
"available" to the business -- and in the absence of s. 63 -- it
might be correct to assert that the changing composition of the business class
and changing social structure demand a reconceptualization.                     However,
I find it unnecessary to determine whether reconceptualization is appropriate
having regard to the presence of s. 63 in the Act.  Section  63
cannot be lightly disregarded (E. A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes
(2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87):  ...
the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their
grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the
object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament.  In fact, as I will now attempt to
demonstrate, I do not believe that ss. 9, 18(1)(a) and 18(1)(h)
can be interpreted to account for a child care business expense deduction, in
light of the language used in s. 63.  (iv)The
Effect of s. 63                     The appellant
argues that the presence of s. 63 in the Act should not affect the
deductibility of child care costs as business expenses.  She suggests that the
language of that provision does not operate to confine taxpayers in making
deductions for child care expenses.  Additionally, she relies upon the decision
in Olympia Floor & Wall Tile (Quebec) Ltd. v. Minister of National
Revenue, [1970] Ex. C.R. 274, to suggest that when a taxpayer has expenses
which exceed an amount made deductible by a specific provision of the Act,
the taxpayer can have recourse to a more general provision in order to deduct
the full amount.  In my opinion, her arguments must fail.                     Considering first
the language of s. 63, it is readily apparent that the Act's
definition of "child care expenses" specifically comprehends the
purpose for which the appellant incurred her nanny expenses.  According to part
of that definition, a child care expense is one incurred in order to provide
child care services "to enable the taxpayer ... to carry on a business
either alone or as a partner":  s. 63(3)(a)(i)(B). 
Furthermore, s. 63(1)(e) operates to cap the deduction with
reference to "earned income", which is defined in s. 63(3)(b)(iii)
to include "incomes from all businesses carried on either alone or as a
partner actively engaged in the business".                       To the extent that
s. 63 intends to limit child care expense deductions to lower earning
supporters, the appellant's position could substantially undermine that
intent.  In this case, the appellant and her husband admittedly made a
"family decision" to the effect that the appellant alone bears the
financial burden of child care:  see Federal Court of Appeal judgment, at
p. 513.  By proffering evidence on this point, the appellant would seek to
avoid the definition of "supporting person" in s. 63(3)(d)
of the Act, which would statutorily define her husband as such a person,
notwithstanding the "family decision".  In the result, she would take
a complete deduction of the child care expenses, free from the consideration of
whether or not she is the lower earning supporter.                     The appellant's
approach is unworkable.  For example, consider the case of two spouses living
with an eligible child, one of whom is an employee earning a low income, and
the other of whom is a businessperson earning a higher income.  The approach of
the appellant clearly invites this couple to make a "family decision"
in order to establish that the cost of child care is the sole responsibility of
the taxpayer with business income.  Without casting aspersions upon the
appellant, I fear that in many cases there would be more bookkeeping than
reality about such a decision.  The courts being poorly suited to assess the
validity of "family decisions" of this sort, I am inclined to believe
that the intent of s. 63 is to prevent the need for such assessments. 
Further, by statutorily defining both parents to be responsible for
child care expenses for tax purposes, s. 63(3)(d) is entirely
congruent with a contemporary understanding of parental obligations in that
regard.                     Additionally, it is
important to acknowledge the context of s. 63 within the Act as a
whole.  Section 63 exists within Division B, subdivision e of the Act. 
As set out in s. 3(c), the deductions permitted by this subdivision
are made only after income from each of the various sources has been
calculated.  In this regard, it is relevant to consider s. 4.  Section
4(1)(a) of the Act provides that each source of income is
initially considered in isolation as one determines the taxpayer's overall
income for the year.  Then, s. 4(2) provides that in applying
s. 4(1), "no deductions permitted by sections 60 to 63 are applicable
either wholly or in part to a particular source".                     Brief reference to
s. 4(2) is made in the respondent's factum.  Aside from this reference,
the section was not otherwise discussed by the parties in this case, and it has
not been the subject of any significant commentary of which I have been made
aware.  For this reason, I do not wish to overstate the importance of
s. 4(2) to my analysis.  Section 4(2) obviously means that the child care
expense deduction in s. 63 is not referable to a particular source of
income.  In other words, the s. 63 calculation is not relevant to the
computation of business income.  Less obviously, however, it may also mean that
the type of deduction provided for in s. 63 (i.e., any
deduction in respect of child care expenses) cannot occur within the source
calculations.  In other words, s. 4(2) may be further evidence that
s. 63 is intended to be a complete legislative response to the child care
expense issue.                     At this point, it
is appropriate to discuss Olympia Floor & Tile, supra, upon
which the appellant relied in order to deny that the specific deduction allowed
by s. 63 must override the potential for a more general deduction
elsewhere in the Act.  In that case, unchallenged evidence was led to
establish that between 25 and 30 percent of a taxpayer's sales in each of two
taxation years went toward charitable gifts.  The taxpayer sought to deduct the
full amount of such gifts, arguing that the sums were expended in order to
increase future sales, and that for this reason, they constituted business
expenses.  The Minister took the position, however, that the deductibility of
the gifts was governed by s. 27(1)(a) of the Act (now see
s. 118.1) which established that a taxpayer could deduct charitable
"gifts" not exceeding 10 percent of the taxpayer's taxable income for
the year.                     Jackett P. accepted
the taxpayer's position.  He was convinced that the taxpayer made the
contributions largely, if not entirely, "for the purpose of increasing its
sales and only subsidiarily, if at all, for charitable or benevolent
reasons" (p. 276).  For this reason, he was satisfied that the
expenses could constitute business expenses, and the important question became
the effect of s. 27(1)(a).  Jackett P. recognized that
s. 27(1)(a) calculated the allowable charitable deduction with
reference to the taxpayer's income, and stated (at p. 282):  ...
it follows that what is being permitted by that provision is a deduction of an
amount that has been given out of the corporation's income after it has been
earned and not a deduction of an amount that has been laid out as part of the
income earning process....                     From this position,
it was then a simple matter for Jackett P. to conclude that the taxpayer's
expense was not the sort of expense contemplated by the language of
s. 27(1)(a).  He did so in the following terms (at p. 284):   In the result, therefore, the taxpayer
could deduct the charitable donations as part of its business profit
calculation, notwithstanding the specific provision relating to the deduction
of charitable gifts.                     The decision of
Jackett P. in Olympia Floor & Tile, supra, has recently been
followed in Impenco Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, 88 D.T.C. 1242
(T.C.C.).  I wish to express neither approval nor disapproval of the approach
taken in either case with respect to the charitable donation issue per se. 
Instead, it is sufficient to highlight the real basis for the decision in Olympia
Floor & Tile.  In my view, what that case says is that a particular
expenditure, such as a charitable donation, may be made for more than one
purpose.  In such a case, it will be relevant to consider whether the actual purpose
of the expenditure is addressed in the Act.  If a specific provision
exists which limits deductibility in respect of that purpose, then that should
be the end of the matter.  If, however, the purpose is not addressed in a
specific provision, recourse may be had to more general rules governing
deductibility.                      Although it is
unnecessary to my conclusion, I wish to note, finally, that evidence of
Parliamentary intent appears to support my view.  At the outset of his reasons,
Décary J.A. in the Federal Court of Appeal reviewed the fiscal history of child
care expenses, as well as government policies on such expenses, and I consider
his discussion helpful.  I wish, however, to make particular note of the
proposals which directly led to the 1972 introduction of s. 63.  In Proposals
for Tax Reform (1969) (E. J. Benson, Minister of Finance), the following
approach to child care expenses is advocated (at p. 15):  2.7  We propose to permit deduction of
the child care expenses that face many working parents today.  The problem of
adequately caring for children when both parents are working, or when there is
only one parent in the family and she or he is working, is both a personal and
a social one.  We consider it desirable on social as well as economic grounds
to permit a tax deduction for child care expenses, under carefully
controlled terms, in addition to the general deduction for children.                                                                      ...  2.9  This
new deduction for child care costs would be a major reform.  While it is not
possible to make an accurate forecast of the number who would benefit from this
new deduction, it seems likely to be several hundred thousand families.  It
would assist many mothers who work or want to work to provide or
supplement the family income, but are discouraged by the cost of having their
children cared for. [Emphasis added.]                     These
proposals suggest to me that s. 63 was intended by Parliament to address
comprehensively child care expenses.  I cannot imagine that a system which
allowed some parents to deduct expenses under general provisions respecting
business income, but which confined others to a s. 63 regime, would permit
deductibility "under carefully controlled terms" within the meaning
of the above quotation.  Further, I am not impressed by the suggestion that
Parliament intended s. 63 to limit deductibility only for employees.  The
proposals do not specify the kind of "work" which is to be
encouraged, and the language of s. 63 clearly addresses income from
business.                     For these reasons,
a straightforward approach to statutory interpretation has led me to conclude
that the Act intends to address child care expenses, and does so in
fact, entirely within s. 63.  It is not necessary for me to decide
whether, in the absence of s. 63, ss. 9, 18(1)(a) and 18(1)(h)
are capable of comprehending a business expense deduction for child care. 
Given s. 63, however, it is clear that child care cannot be considered
deductible under principles of income tax law applicable to business
deductions.  (b)If
child care expenses are not otherwise deductible under principles of income tax
law applicable to business deductions, are they deductible as such using the
values of the Charter  as an interpretive aid?                     The appellant
argued that the values of the Charter  can be used in this case as an
interpretive aid.  In particular, reliance is placed upon the decisions of this
Court in Hills v. Canada (Attorney General), supra, and Slaight
Communications Inc. v. Davidson, supra.                      Appellant,
while not relying on any specific provision of the Charter , nevertheless
urged that preference be given to Charter  values in the interpretation
of a statute, namely freedom of association.  I agree that the values embodied
in the Charter  must be given preference over an interpretation which
would run contrary to them....                     In a similar
fashion, in Slaight Communications, supra, this Court was asked
to determine whether the language of certain labour legislation conferred upon
an adjudicator the power to make a particular kind of order.  In responding,
Lamer J. (as he then was) stated the following (at p. 1078):  Although
this Court must not add anything to legislation or delete anything from it in
order to make it consistent with the Charter , there is no doubt in my
mind that it should also not interpret legislation that is open to more than
one interpretation so as to make it inconsistent with the Charter  and
hence of no force or effect.  Legislation conferring an imprecise discretion
must therefore be interpreted as not allowing the Charter  rights to be
infringed.                     I agree with the
sentiment reflected in both of these quotations, but I fail to see their
relevance in this case.  In both Hills and Slaight Communications,
this Court was confronted with statutory language which was ambiguous.  In each
case, the values of the Charter  were consulted to resolve the
ambiguity.  However, each case recognizes that to consult the Charter  in
the absence of such ambiguity is to deprive the Charter of a more
powerful purpose, namely, the determination of a statute's constitutional validity. 
If statutory meanings must be made congruent with the Charter  even in
the absence of ambiguity, then it would never be possible to apply,
rather than simply consult, the values of the Charter . 
Furthermore, it would never be possible for the government to justify
infringements as reasonable limits under s. 1  of the Charter , since the
interpretive process would preclude one from finding infringements in the first
place.                     Had s. 63 not
been present, it might be arguable that the equality values in the Charter 
could have informed the interpretation of ss. 9, 18(1)(a) and
18(1)(h) of the Act.  However, as already discussed, s. 63
eliminates any question of ambiguity, and by so doing, also eliminates the need
for recourse to Charter  values in this case.  My analysis of the Income
Tax Act has ineluctably led me to conclude that the Act does not
permit a business expense deduction in respect of child care as part of its
s. 9 profit calculation, but instead limits the child care deduction in
accordance with s. 63.                     Accordingly, with
respect to those taxation years not directly reviewable in constitutional terms
by s. 15(1)  of the Charter , I would affirm the reassessments by
Revenue Canada which disallowed the deductions claimed by the appellant.  2.If
child care expenses are not deductible as part of the determination of profit
under s. 9(1) of the Act, has there been a violation of s. 15(1)  of
the Charter ?                     (a)Can
s. 15(1) of the Charter  be Applied to the Income Tax Act?                     A preliminary
"debate" took place before this Court which questioned the propriety
of using the Charter  to challenge the scheme of deductibility created by
the Act.  With respect to this debate, I have two brief comments.                     First, it has been
suggested that to subject the Act to the Charter  would risk
"overshooting" the purposes of the Charter .  However, the
danger of "overshooting" relates not to the kinds of
legislation which are subject to the Charter , but to the proper
interpretive approach which courts should adopt as they imbue Charter 
rights and freedoms with meaning:  see R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd.,
[1985] 1 S.C.R. 295, at p. 344.  Second, it has been said that courts should
defer to legislatures with respect to difficult economic questions.  However,
support for this proposition is said to come from cases in which a degree of
deference has been exhibited as part of a s. 1  Charter  analysis: 
see, e.g., PSAC v. Canada, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 424, at p. 442.  Such cases
do not advocate a deferential approach at any earlier stage of Charter 
analysis.                     Since neither of
the two propositions upon which this preliminary "debate" was founded
can withstand even brief critical analysis, I consider it unnecessary to
comment further in this regard.  The Act is certainly not insulated
against all forms of Charter  review.                     (b)Section 15(1) 
of the Charter :  A Method of Analysis                     Before turning to
the specifics of the s. 15(1)  infringement alleged by the appellant, it is
convenient to set forth some of the basic principles of Charter  equality
analysis which will structure my approach.  Many of these principles are
derived directly from Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia, supra,
wherein this Court began the important process of giving shape to s. 15(1) 
of the Charter .  As I restate these principles, however, I must be
mindful of the fact that equality "is an elusive concept and, more than
any of the other rights and freedoms guaranteed in the Charter , it lacks
precise definition":  Andrews, at p. 164.                     At the outset, it
is important to realize that, in order to determine whether particular facts
demonstrate equality or inequality, one must necessarily undertake a form of
comparative analysis.  For the purposes of s. 15(1) , Andrews has
rejected that the analysis should be governed by the comparison of similarly
situated persons.  Section 15(1)  guarantees more than formal equality; it
guarantees that equality will be mainly concerned with "the impact of the
law on the individual or the group concerned":  Andrews, at
p. 165.  McIntyre J. stated (at p. 164) that equality  is a
comparative concept, the condition of which may only be attained or discerned
by comparison with the condition of others in the social and political setting
in which the question arises.  It must be recognized at once, however, that
every difference in treatment between individuals under the law will not
necessarily result in inequality and, as well, that identical treatment may
frequently produce serious inequality. [Emphasis added.]                     The s. 15(1) 
challenge, of course, is to determine whether a "difference in
treatment" between individuals, or an "identical treatment" of
individuals, engages the Charter .  Stated another way, the goal is to
ensure that "a law expressed to bind all should not because of irrelevant
personal differences have a more burdensome or less beneficial impact on one
than another":  Andrews, at p. 165.  In pursuit of this goal,
McIntyre J. in Andrews took the comparative analysis a step further and
suggested that the Charter  was not intended to eliminate all
distinctions, but, in keeping with the language and purpose of s. 15 , only
those distinctions which are "discriminatory".                     Fortunately, in
both Andrews and the present case, this Court has been able to access a
rich jurisprudence associated with human rights legislation.  The concept of
"discrimination" within s. 15(1)  of the Charter  has been
informed by this jurisprudence, and McIntyre J.'s definition of the term in Andrews
is proof of its utility.  McIntyre J. stated (at p. 174):  I
would say then that discrimination may be described as a distinction, whether
intentional or not but based on grounds relating to personal characteristics of
the individual or group, which has the effect of imposing burdens, obligations,
or disadvantages on such individual or group not imposed upon others, or which
withholds or limits access to opportunities, benefits, and advantages available
to other members of society.  McIntyre J. went on to conclude that
an approach to s. 15(1)  which comprehends both enumerated and analogous
grounds of discrimination most closely accords with this definition.  One
reason for his conclusion is that such an approach has the advantage of leaving
questions of justification to s. 1  of the Charter .                      A
distinction must be made between what I would describe as direct discrimination
and the concept already referred to as adverse effect discrimination in
connection with employment.  Direct discrimination occurs in this connection
where an employer adopts a practice or rule which on its face discriminates on
a prohibited ground.  For example, "No Catholics or no women or no blacks
employed here."... On the other hand, there is the concept of adverse
effect discrimination.  It arises where an employer for genuine business
reasons adopts a rule or standard which is on its face neutral, and which will
apply equally to all employees, but which has a discriminatory effect upon a
prohibited ground on one employee or group of employees in that it imposes,
because of some special characteristic of the employee or group, obligations,
penalties, or restrictive conditions not imposed on other members of the work
force.  In the same case, McIntyre J. came to
the related conclusion that animus is irrelevant to discrimination.  A
finding of discrimination can be made even if there has been no intention
to discriminate.                      In
determining whether there is discrimination on grounds relating to the personal
characteristics of the individual or group, it is important to look not only at
the impugned legislation which has created a distinction that violates the
right to equality but also to the larger social, political and legal
context.... Accordingly, it is only by examining the larger context that a
court can determine whether differential treatment results in inequality or
whether, contrariwise, it would be identical treatment which would in the
particular context result in inequality or foster disadvantage.  A finding that
there is discrimination will, I think, in most but perhaps not all cases,
necessarily entail a search for disadvantage that exists apart from and
independent of the particular legal distinction being challenged.                      In R. v. Swain,
[1991] 1 S.C.R. 933, Lamer C.J. summarized s. 15(1)  jurisprudence in terms
which encapsulate the main elements of the s. 15(1)  discussion I have set
out here.  He stated (at p. 992):   Before making this statement, the
Chief Justice acknowledged that it is unwise to attempt exhaustive definitions
during the early years of s. 15(1)  interpretation (see Turpin, supra,
at p. 1326).  Likewise, I must mention that by repeating points set out in
other cases, I am not proposing that those points now constitute a
"test" for s. 15(1) .  Rather, I simply believe that on the facts
of this case, it is not necessary to go beyond the view of equality summarized
above.  (c)Section 15(1) 
of the Charter  in this Case                      It is important to
clarify my understanding of the appellant's Charter  challenge at the
outset, since the focus of her s. 15(1)  attack is by no means obvious.  In
particular, I must deal with the appellant's preliminary characterization of Income
Tax Act deductions as "benefits" which are equivalent to
"government expenditures".  This characterization implicitly involves
a tax theory concept known as the "tax expenditure".  To prevent that
concept from introducing confusion with respect to the s. 15(1)  challenge,
I must comment upon it briefly.                     In his important
work, Pathways to Tax Reform (1973), Professor Stanley S. Surrey of
Harvard proposed that a deduction which departs from the normative tax system
is, in many ways, the logical equivalent of a direct government subsidy.  Such
deductions have been called "tax expenditures", and they have been
explained in the following terms (S. S. Surrey and P. R. McDaniel, Tax
Expenditures (1985), at p. 3):                      I believe that to
characterize initially the child care expense deduction as a tax expenditure in
this case can be problematic.  In order to view the child care expense
deduction as a government expenditure within the meaning of the above
quotation, one must conclude that the deduction is allowed outside the
normative tax system, a system which directly disallows the deduction. 
Following this line of argument, it then seems that two Charter 
challenges rather than one would arise:  one would challenge the expenditure as
a benefit, the other would challenge the scheme of the normative system.                     In this case,
however, my approach to statutory interpretation does not involve any attempt
to determine whether s. 63 constitutes a part of the normative tax system
or not.  In fact, that determination is not a legal goal, but a goal of tax
theory.  Instead, I have simply found that s. 63 constitutes a complete code
with respect to child care expenses.  In my view, therefore, there is only one Charter 
argument available in this case, and the proper focus of that argument is
s. 63.                      In this respect, I
agree with the following statement which considers the impact of the tax
expenditure concept in Charter  analysis (Woodman, "Some Modest
Proposals", supra, at p. 386):                      Tax
expenditure analysis does not solve the problems inherent in Charter 
challenges to the income tax system.  It does, however, make it clearer what
the argument is about. [Emphasis added.]  As alluded to within this quotation,
it may become useful, at some stage of a Charter  analysis of income
taxation, to return to the notion that a deduction can be viewed as a kind of
expenditure, since such an approach allows one to examine the government's
overall approach to related expenditures.  Such an examination, however, is not
the first problem to be addressed under a s. 15(1)  Charter 
analysis.  As will be discussed, such an examination more properly belongs within
a s. 1  analysis.                     These brief remarks
will, I hope, clarify the proper focus for the appellant's Charter 
challenge.  To proceed, the Charter  s. 15(1)  question can be
restated.  Since this Court is confronted with a provision in a federal
statute, there is no doubt that a "law", i.e. s. 63, exists
within the meaning of s. 15(1) :  Andrews, supra, at
p. 164.  The relevant question is, therefore, the following:  does
s. 63 of the Act infringe the right to equality guaranteed by
s. 15(1)  of the Charter ?                     As my summary of
s. 15(1)  jurisprudence above demonstrates, the answer to this question
must come in parts.  First, it must be determined whether s. 63
establishes an inequality:  does s. 63 draw a distinction (intentionally
or otherwise) between the appellant and others, based upon a personal
characteristic?  Second, if an inequality is found, it must be determined
whether the inequality results in discrimination:  does the distinction drawn
by s. 63 have the effect of imposing a burden, obligation or disadvantage
not imposed upon others or of withholding or limiting access to opportunities,
benefits and advantages available to others?  Finally, assuming that both an
inequality and discrimination can be found, it must be determined whether the
personal characteristic at issue constitutes either an enumerated or analogous
ground for the purposes of s. 15(1)  of the Charter .                     With respect to
whether s. 63 creates a distinction, the language of s. 63 must be
separated from its effect.  Clearly, the language of that provision does not
include terms which expressly limit the child care expense deduction to one sex
or the other.  Instead, for the sake of simplicity in light of s. 63's
multifaceted requirements, I can state that s. 63 creates a facial distinction
between those supporting persons who incur child care expenses with respect to
an eligible child, and those persons who do not.  In passing, I note that,
while the trial judge discussed s. 15(1)  of the Charter  with
respect to the "personal characteristics of sex and family or parental
status" (p. 84), the appellant's arguments before this Court narrowed
and effectively dealt only with the first of these.  Facially, then, the
distinction created by s. 63 is not based upon the personal characteristic
put forward by the appellant, namely, sex.                     What,
however, is the effect of the distinction created by s. 63?  Does
s. 63 have an effect which draws a distinction on the basis of sex?  More
particularly, in light of the manner in which this appeal has been framed, does
s. 63 have an adverse effect upon women who must incur child care expenses
to enable the pursuit of business income?                     An abundance of
information was placed before this Court which conclusively demonstrates that
women bear a disproportionate share of the child care burden in Canada.  For
example, at trial, the expert witness asserted this point, and stated further
that the burden is disproportionate whether or not women work outside the
home.  Similarly, Statistics Canada reports that working men are primarily
responsible for child care in only six percent of families:  S. Crompton,
"Who's Looking After the Kids?  Child Care Arrangements of Working
Mothers", in Statistics Canada, Perspectives on Labour and Income,
vol. 3, No. 2 (Summer 1991), at p. 68.  Likewise, it has been noted that
"most women, even those with very young children, are now in the labour
force", and that "fully 70% of employed mothers with children younger
than 6 years old work full time":  D. S. Lero, et al., Canadian
National Child Care Study:  Parental Work Patterns and Child Care Needs
(1992), at p. 23.                       Unfortunately, the
factual background of this case tends to obscure the problem faced by the
appellant with respect to s. 15(1) .  As I have already discussed, the
appellant and her husband made a "family decision" to the effect that
the appellant alone was to bear the financial burden of having children.  If,
extrapolating from this circumstance, it could be said that women, far more
than men, pay child care expenses, the limitations imposed by s. 63 might
well create the adverse effect the appellant must demonstrate.  However, it is
difficult to imagine how such statistics could arise.  I say this because the
"family decision" made by the appellant and her husband is not
mandated by law and public policy.  In the Criminal Code  provisions
alluded to, supra, in contemporary family law, and particularly in the
definition of "supporting person" in s. 63(3)(d) of the Act,
parents (and particularly parents living with children) are viewed as having joint
legal responsibility to care for children.  In most households involving more
than one supporting person, therefore, regardless of "family
decisions", the law will impose the legal duty to share the burden of
child care expenses, if not necessarily a duty to share the child care
burden itself.                     Stated another way,
I believe that the appellant has presented this Court with evidence of the social
burden of child care, and has asked that from this burden, we infer that a positive
child care expense burden is also placed directly upon women, and
particularly upon businesswomen, including businesswomen who are married.  I
note the following remark from the Abella Report on equality in employment (R.
S. Abella, Report of the Commission on Equality in Employment
(1984), at p. 177):  By
Canadian law both parents have a duty to care for their children, but by custom
this responsibility has consistently fallen to the mother.  It is the mother,
therefore, who bears any guilt or social disapprobation for joining the
workforce.  And it is the mother who normally bears the psychological and
actual responsibility for making childcare arrangements.                     If the adverse
effects analysis is to be coherent, it must not assume that a statutory
provision has an effect which is not proved.  We must take care to distinguish
between effects which are wholly caused, or are contributed to, by an impugned
provision, and those social circumstances which exist independently of such a
provision.  In this case, that means that one must be cognizant of the fact
that s. 63 defines child care expenses as an actual expense of
money.  In order to demonstrate a distinction between the sexes within an
adverse effects analysis, one therefore needs to prove that s. 63
disproportionately limits the deduction with respect to actual expenses
incurred by women.                     In my opinion, the
appellant taxpayer has failed to demonstrate an adverse effect created or
contributed to by s. 63, although she has overwhelmingly demonstrated how
the issue of child care negatively affects women in employment terms. 
Unfortunately, proof that women pay social costs is not sufficient proof that
women pay child care expenses.  Those social costs, although very real, exist
outside of the Act.  In the same fashion that our income taxation system
does not recognize various forms of imputed income, it equally does not
involve itself with any form of imputed expense.  In this respect, this
appeal was not argued to suggest that the government had a positive obligation
to account for the social costs of child care prior to taxing its citizens. 
Such a suggestion would lead this Court well beyond the confines of the present
appeal.                     I conclude,
therefore, that the appellant is unable to demonstrate a violation of
s. 15(1)  of the Charter  with respect to s. 63 of the Act,
since she has not proved that s. 63 draws a distinction based upon the
personal characteristic of sex.  In reaching this conclusion, however, I wish
to note that I do not reject that such a distinction might be proved in another
case.  The appellant in this case belongs to a particular subgroup of women,
namely, married women who are entrepreneurs.  It is important to realize that
her evidentiary focus was skewed in this direction.                       Undoubtedly, it was
the juxtaposition of s. 8(2) with s. 9 of the Act which led
the appellant to take the position she took.  By virtue of s. 8(2) of the Act,
employees are generally prohibited from making any deductions from employment
income.  Accordingly, the appellant thought it desirable to distance herself
from employees in this case.  When considering her arguments with respect to
statutory interpretation, this approach is understandable.  When considering
her Charter  arguments, it is less so.                      Equally, the
material which has been placed before this Court demonstrates certain
distinctions created by s. 63, but no attempt has been made to link these
distinctions to personal characteristics comprehended by an enumerated or analogous
grounds approach to s. 15(1)  of the Charter .  In this respect, I
note the following comment from the Report of the Task Force on Child Care,
supra, at p. 173, which relates to the earned income limitations in
s. 63:                       First,
to say that the s. 63 deduction is more often denied to women is to
recognize a reality, namely, that when there are two supporting persons in a
household, the woman is more often the lower income earner.  Although both
supporting persons contribute to the actual child care expenses incurred, the
deduction will be denied to the woman as the lower income earner.  In this
sense, then, the woman is more often "affected" by s. 63. 
However, to describe s. 63 in this fashion is not to admit that s. 63
has an "adverse effect" which subordinates women.  As I described
above, to deny the deduction to women would only exaggerate a societal
inequality if the woman in question actually paid more child care
expenses.  Since, as I have already indicated, proof is lacking on this point,
the only obvious distinction is a parental one.  And, as just noted, the
appellant's focus has effectively excluded parental status arguments.                       At issue in Brooks
v. Canada Safeway Ltd. was whether a health insurance plan which denied
benefits to pregnant women was discriminatory on the basis of sex.  Obviously,
not all women become pregnant, nor do those women who become pregnant all
become pregnant at the same time.  Nonetheless, discrimination on the basis of
sex was found.  Dickson C.J. stated (at p. 1247):    While
the concept of discrimination is rooted in the notion of treating an individual
as part of a group rather than on the basis of the individual's personal
characteristics, discrimination does not require uniform treatment of all
members of a particular group.  It is sufficient that ascribing to an
individual a group characteristic is one factor in the treatment of that
individual.  If a finding of discrimination required that every individual in
the affected group be treated identically, legislative protection against
discrimination would be of little or no value.                       Following upon this
acknowledgment, however, the important thing to realize is that there is a
difference between being able to point to individuals negatively
affected by a provision, and being able to prove that a group or
subgroup is suffering an adverse effect in law by virtue of an
impugned provision.  As already noted, proof of inequality is a comparative
process:  Andrews, supra.  If a group or subgroup of women could
prove the adverse effect required, the proof would come in a comparison with
the relevant body of men.  Accordingly, although individual men might be
negatively affected by an impugned provision, those men would not belong to a
group or subgroup of men able to prove the required adverse effect.  In other
words, only women could make the adverse effects claim, and this is entirely
consistent with statements such as that found in Brooks, supra,
to the effect that "only women have the capacity to become pregnant"
(at p. 1242).                      (d)Conclusions
With Respect to s. 15(1)  of the Charter                     Given the
evidentiary focus of this case, I have concluded that the appellant has not
proved that s. 63 of the Act involves a distinction between men and
women, as required by the equality challenge she has brought under
s. 15(1)  of the Charter .  Accordingly, the limitations upon child
care deductions in that section have not been proved to be unconstitutional in
this case.  Revenue Canada's reassessment of the appellant's deductions in
respect of taxation year 1985 is affirmed.  3.Concluding comments with respect to
s. 1  of the Charter                     Although many
complex equality issues inform the present appeal, I have concluded that the
appeal should be dismissed since the evidentiary foundation inadequately
supports the appellant's position.  In concluding in that fashion, however, I
felt compelled above to make certain remarks relating to the kind of evidence
needed in such a case, and relating to the nature of sex discrimination in an
adverse effects case involving the Income Tax Act.  To complete this
process, it may be helpful to make two remarks with respect to s. 1  of the
Charter , notwithstanding that recourse to s. 1  is unnecessary in
this case, and notwithstanding that I do not intend to engage in a s. 1 
analysis as such.                       Instead of focusing
upon the manner in which s. 63 of the Act operates as a child care
system, the present appeal focused only upon the propriety of an instrumental
result.  This Court was invited to use the Charter  to rectify a
disadvantage allegedly suffered by businesswomen vis à vis businessmen,
and, in the process, this Court was invited to ignore the effect of allowing a
complete deduction on the rest of the system.  At the s. 1  stage of Charter 
analysis, however, such an instrumental approach is inappropriate.  In order to
examine properly the validity of legislative objectives in a case such as the
present one, it is important to consider both the operation of the Act
as a whole, and the operation of other government systems relating to child
care.                       The Task Force on
Child Care did not recommend that the future development of a child care
system contain relief in the form of tax measures, although, in the interim, it
was recommended that the deductibility levels established by s. 63 be left
intact:  supra, at p. 375.  In my opinion, it would be strange
indeed for this Court to consider uncapping a child care expense deduction,
without even considering the very real drawbacks of tax deductions in equality
terms.                     In a similar
fashion, I do not believe that the tax deduction for child care expenses could
be properly examined by this Court without consideration being given to the
entire range of government responses to family and child care issues.  If inequities
are proved to exist within s. 63, surely it must be relevant to consider
the extent to which other government programs respond to those inequities.  I
do not, by any means, wish to suggest that a complete response to child care
exists in Canada, nor do I say that courts need only arrange the pieces of a
complicated child care puzzle.  Instead, I simply wish to recognize that proper
examination of a taxation response to child care expenses requires one to
contextualize the fiscal response to the greatest degree possible, in order to
determine whether an apparent inequality discloses a justifiable legislative
objective of a much broader kind.                     Having made these
brief remarks, I consider it unnecessary to further consider s. 1  of the Charter ,
or the appropriateness of the s. 15(1)  challenge in this case.  VI.Conclusion                     For
the foregoing reasons, I conclude that child care expenses are deductible
solely under s. 63 of the Act, and that s. 63 represents a
systemic response to child care in income tax terms.  With respect to the
constitutional questions, I conclude that no violation of s. 15  of the Charter 
has been proved in this case, and, in particular, that s. 63 has not been
proved to violate the appellant's right to equality.  This being the case, it
is unnecessary to consider the second constitutional question.                     More specifically,
I would answer the constitutional questions as follows:  Question
1:If ss. 9, 18 and 63 of the Income Tax Act are not open to an
interpretation other than that full child care expenses of the appellant are
not deductible as business expenses, does any part, or do any or all of these
sections, infringe or deny rights guaranteed by s. 15  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?  Answer:No.  Question
2:To the extent that the above sections of the Income Tax Act infringe
or deny the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 15  of the Canadian Charter
of Rights and Freedoms , are these sections justified by s. 1  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution
Act, 1982 ?  Answer:It
is not necessary to answer this question.                     I would dismiss the
appeal with costs and affirm the Minister's reassessments which disallowed the
deductions claimed by the appellant.                     The following are
the reasons delivered by                     L'Heureux-Dubé
J. (dissenting) -- Ms.
Elizabeth Symes is a lawyer and as such a businesswoman; she is also the mother
of two children.  During the taxation years 1982 through 1985, she claimed her
child care expenses as a "business expense" under the provisions of
the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148 (the "Act"). 
This appeal concerns the statutory interpretation of the Act and, in
particular, ss. 9, 18(1)(a), 18(1)(h) and 63.  It also
requires that we ask fundamental and complex questions about the visions of
equality and inclusivity that mould our legal constructs.  I.Facts                     The relevant facts
can be easily summarized and are not contested.  Elizabeth Symes practises in
the legal profession and between 1982 and 1985 hired a nanny, Mrs. Simpson, to
care for her two children so that she could work.  During the 1982, 1983, 1984
and 1985 taxation years, she deducted the salary she paid to Mrs. Simpson as a
business expense.  The Minister of National Revenue (MNR) disallowed these
deductions, although he allowed a revised child care deduction under s. 63(1)
of the Act of $1,000 for the 1982 expense, a $2,000 deduction for the
1983 and 1984 expense and a $4,000 deduction for the 1985 expense.  The MNR disallowed
the deductions on the basis that the wages paid were personal or living
expenses under s. 18(1)(h) of the Act, and not outlays or
expenses incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing income from business
under s. 18(1)(a) of the Act.                     Ms. Symes appealed
the MNR's reassessments to the Federal Court, Trial Division.  Cullen J.
concluded that the child care expenses could be deducted as a business
expense.  The respondent appealed to the Federal Court of Appeal, which allowed
the appeal and restored the notices of reassessment issued by the MNR.  II.Relevant
Statutory Provisions  Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, as amended:                     3. The income of a taxpayer for a

the taxpayer or a supporting person of the child for the year ...                     to the extent that  (c) the
amount is not included in computing the amount deductible under this subsection
by an individual (other than the taxpayer), and  (d) the
amount is not an amount (other than an amount that is included in computing a
taxpayer's income and that is not deductible in computing his taxable income)
in respect of which any taxpayer is or was entitled to a reimbursement or any
other form of assistance,  and
the payment of which is proven by filing with the Minister one or more receipts
each of which was issued by the payee and contains, where the payee is an
individual, that individual's Social Insurance Number; but not exceeding the
amount, if any, by which  (e) the
least of                     (i)  $8,000,  (ii) the
product obtained when $2,000 is multiplied by the number of eligible children
of the taxpayer for the year in respect of whom the child care expenses were
incurred, and  (iii) 2/3
of the taxpayer's earned income for the year  exceeds  (f)  the
aggregate of all amounts each of which is an amount deducted, in respect of the
eligible children of the taxpayer that are referred to in subparagraph (e)(ii),
under this subsection for the year by an individual (other than the taxpayer)
to whom subsection (2) is applicable for the year.                                                                      ...                     (3)  In
this section,  (a) "child
care expense" means an expense incurred for the purpose of providing in
Canada, for any eligible child of a taxpayer, child care services including
baby sitting services, day nursery services or lodging at a boarding school or
camp if the services were provided  (i) to
enable the taxpayer, or the supporting person of the child for the year, who
resided with the child at the time the expense was incurred,  (A) to
perform the duties of an office or employment,  (B) to

child of the taxpayer or of his spouse, or  (ii) a
child in respect of whom the taxpayer deducted an amount under section 109 for
the year,  if,
at any time during the year, the child was under 14 years of age or was over 13
years of age and dependent on the taxpayer by reason of mental or physical
infirmity; and  (d)  "supporting
person" of an eligible child of a taxpayer for a taxation year means                     (i) a
parent of the child,                     (ii) the
taxpayer's spouse, or  (iii) an
individual who deducted an amount under section 109 for the year in respect of
the child,  if
the parent, spouse or individual, as the case may be, resided with the taxpayer
at any time during the year and at any time within 60 days after the end of the
year.  III.Judgments  Federal Court, Trial Division, [1989] 3 F.C.
59 (Cullen J.)                     Finding for the
appellant Symes, the trial judge stated that to determine which expenses may be
considered business expenses in the calculation of business profit, one should
examine whether the expense was consistent with "ordinary principles of commercial
trading or well accepted principles of business practice" (pp. 66-67). 
Furthermore, the expense should be made or incurred "for the purpose of
gaining or producing income from the business" (p. 67).  Cullen J. found
that there was an increasing tendency to interpret s. 18(1)(a) of the Act
more liberally.  He added that, since the term "profit" in s. 9 of
the Act was not defined, it was up to the courts to "infuse the
term with meaning, which will reflect the realities of the times" (p.
71).                     To that end, Cullen
J. took note of the testimony of the expert witness, Dr. Patricia Armstrong,
who indicated that there has been significant social change in the late 1970s
and into the 1980s, in terms of the influx of women of child-bearing age into
business and into the workplace.  Since this change post-dated the cases in
which child care expenses were not allowed as a legitimate business deduction,
Cullen J. found that his interpretation was not restricted by these cases.                     He concluded that
"it can be said that there is a causal relationship between the dedication
of resources generated in [the appellant's] practice to child care and the
generation of those resources" (p. 73).  He also was satisfied that the
plaintiff exercised good business judgment is deciding to dedicate part of her
resources from the law practice to the provision of child care. He stated, at
p. 73:  This
decision was acceptable according to business principles which include the
development of intellectual capital, the improvement of productivity, the
provision of services to clients and making available the resource which she
sells, namely her time.                     Further,
Armstrong's evidence supports the notion that the availability of child care
increases productivity by enhancing the peace of mind of employees.  Enhancing
productivity is something that is totally in keeping with well established
business practices.                     Cullen J. then
examined s. 63 of the Act, which deals with child care expenses, and
found that this section had been enacted "to facilitate the entry of women
into the labour force, thereby promoting economic equality between the sexes as
well as providing relief for low income families" (p. 75).  However, he
concluded that, since the nanny's salary was deductible as a business expense
pursuant to ss. 9 and 18(1)(a) of the Act, s. 63 could not
"prevent it from being allowed as such" (p. 75).                     Having found that
Ms. Symes' child care expenses were legitimate business expenses, Cullen J. was
not required to examine the impact of s. 15  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms .  However, he did.  He held that s. 15  of the Charter ,
which was proclaimed into force on April 17, 1985, was applicable to part of
the 1985 taxation year and to the subsequent taxation years.  Cullen J.,
relying on the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Andrews v. Law
Society of British Columbia, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 143, concluded that the MNR,
by refusing the appellant's deduction, was "treating her differently from
other taxpayers with expenses that are considered necessary to generate
business income" (p. 80).  He added that the MNR was not treating the
appellant "like a serious business person with a serious expense incurred
for a legitimate purpose" (p. 81).  In fact, the appellant was
"treated like any employer who is incurring a business expense but yet she
is not allowed to deduct that expense", which meant that she was paying
more taxes.  He found this to be contrary to the purpose of s. 15  of the Charter .                     Cullen J. also used
s. 15  of the Charter  as an aid in interpreting the Act.  In his
view, since the Andrews decision, the Act must be interpreted in
a way which recognizes the specific experience of women as principally
responsible for child care.  He also observed that an interpretation of the Act
which ignores the reality that women bear a major responsibility for child
rearing and which ignores that the cost of child care is a major barrier to
women's participation in the workforce would by itself violate s. 15  of the Charter .                     Thus, the trial
judge concluded that the appellant had suffered discrimination based on her
personal characteristics as a parent and a woman and that this had the effect
of imposing on her burdens, obligations and disadvantages not borne by others.                     Turning, then, to
s. 1  of the Charter , Cullen J. found that the respondent had not proven
a "pressing and substantial" objective to justify the disallowance of
child care expenses as a business deduction, and felt no need to engage in a
lengthy s. 1  analysis.  He asserted that his interpretation of the word
"profit" in the Act was in conformity with the Charter .                     In the result,
Cullen J. held that the appellant was allowed to deduct the cost of her nanny
as a business expense, pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Act. 
He added (at p. 87) that, although the concepts of profit and business expense
permitted the deduction of the nanny's salary in the present case, "[t]his
is not to say that nanny expenses will always be treated as a business expense,
or that section 63 of the Act has been invalidated under section 52  of the
Charter ".  Federal Court of Appeal, [1991] 3 F.C. 507 (Décary J.A.,
Pratte and MacGuigan JJ.A. concurring)                     The Federal Court
of Appeal reversed the decision of Cullen J.  Décary J.A., for the court,
dismissed the argument that the existence of a legal obligation to care for
children was a reason for allowing child care expenses to be deducted as a
business expense.  According to him, this obligation, imposed equally on both
sexes, was a "natural obligation" which affected parents at all
times, since "[t]he law does not impose an obligation on the [appellant]
to look after her children because she is operating a business" (p. 522). 
While agreeing that judicial interpretation should be "flexible and
sensitive to adapt to changing circumstances", Décary J.A. pursued at p.
523:  ...
the concept of a business expense has been developed exclusively in relation to
the commercial needs of the business, without any regard to the particular
needs of those in charge of the business, and I have difficulty in seeing how a
change in the particular needs of these persons could justify modifying an
interpretation which has nothing to do with these needs....  I consider that
the case at bar does not require a conclusion on this point for the simple
reason that Parliament has itself already amended the Income Tax Act to
provide for the specific situation relied on by the [appellant].  Décary J.A. based his conclusion on
the fact that, in his view, ss. 63(3)(a)(i) and 63(3)(b) of the Act
covered self-employed parents as well as salaried parents, the term
"parent" meaning the individual providing support for a child.  He
held that "[h]ad section 63 been drafted to apply specifically to the
[appellant's] case, it would not have been drafted otherwise" and added
that s. 63(3)(b)(iii) of the Act, which defined "earned
income" as including "incomes from all businesses carried on either
alone or as a partner actively engaged in the business", led him to the
conclusion that the appellant's earned income which derived from her
partnership was "income which is covered by section 63" (p. 524).  He
stated at p. 525:  Section
63 is really a code in itself, complete and independent, and it does not matter
in the circumstances whether it was inserted in one subdivision of the Act
rather than another, as by its very wording, which is clear and not open to
question, it covers a parent carrying on a business and income earned by the
parent from the operation of a business.  In his view, s. 63 of the Act
had been amended many times to take into account social and economic changes
and he concluded that the appellant's situation was exactly the kind of
situation that Parliament had in mind when it enacted s. 63 of the Act
and its amendments.                     Décary J.A., then,
turned to s. 15  of the Charter , in the context of economic rights.  To
that end, he examined the jurisprudence and, in particular, Andrews v. Law
Society of British Columbia, supra, and PSAC v. Canada,
[1987] 1 S.C.R. 424, to conclude that the appellant's approach "risks 
trivializing the Charter " and, moreover, at pp. 530-31, that:                     The
respondent's proposition appears to mean, for all practical purposes, that
through the right to equality recognized in section 15 , the Charter  guarantees
individuals every right, whether or not included in those expressly defined in
the Charter . For example, in the case at bar, though the right to work and the
right to be in a position to work are not recognized by the Charter , an individual
-- on these facts a woman, a parent, but it could be anyone who can make use of
the provisions of section 15  -- could under cover of section 15  require
legislatures to adopt measures enabling him or her to work and be in a position
to work.  That is not the effect of section 15 .                     In
my opinion, no one could have required Parliament to adopt section 63 and allow
a parent to deduct child care costs. Parliament adopted section 63 in the
enlightened exercise of its discretion, and I do not see on what basis a
particular group of professional women or parents, benefitting from the
deduction allowed by that section, could require that the section be amended by
the legislature or interpreted by the courts so as to give the group the right
to take a further deduction....  I do
not see how a provision which favours all women could directly or indirectly
infringe the right of women to equality, and I am not prepared to concede that
professional women make up a disadvantaged group against whom a form of
discrimination recognized by section 15  has been perpetrated by the adopting of
section 63, or would be perpetrated by this Court's refusal to interpret
paragraph 18(1)(a) so as to give a self-employed mother an additional
deduction for a business expense....  In the event, however, that there was
discrimination within the meaning of s. 15  of the Charter , Décary J.A.
felt that it was not the function of the court, based on the evidence of
justification presented before the court, to substitute its choice for that of
Parliament.  IV.Issues                     The Chief Justice
formulated the following constitutional questions:  1. 
If ss. 9, 18 and 63 of the Income Tax Act are not open to an
interpretation other than that full child care expenses of the appellant are
not deductible as business expenses, does any part, or do any or all of these
sections, infringe or deny rights guaranteed by s. 15  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?  2. 
To the extent that the above sections of the Income Tax Act infringe or
deny the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 15  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms , are these sections justified by s. 1  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution
Act, 1982 ?                     In order to reach
these constitutional questions, one must first determine whether ss. 9, 18 and
63 of the Act are open to an interpretation that child care expenses are,
in fact, deductible as a business expense.  Although this issue is primarily
one of statutory interpretation, nevertheless, this case remains deeply
pervaded by issues of equality.  The appellant asks that the Court find that s.
15  of the Charter  would be infringed by an interpretation of the Act
that would disallow the deduction of child care as a legitimate business
expense.  The arguments of the parties and interveners make it clear that,
though ostensibly about the proper statutory interpretation of the Act,
this case reflects a far more complex struggle over fundamental issues, the
meaning of equality and the extent to which these values require that women's
experience be considered when the interpretation of legal concepts is at
issue.  The answer, with regard to the statutory interpretation of the Act, requires
that the Court consider the reality of the relationship of both women and men
to child care and to work, as well as the impact of concepts of equality on the
interpretation of legislation.  As Professor Claire F. L. Young has written in
"Impact of Feminist Analysis on Tax Law and Policy" in Feminist
Analysis: Challenging Law and Legal Processes (1992 Institute of Continuing
Legal Education, Canadian Bar Association -- Ontario, January 31, 1992), at p.
1:  The
tax system is ... a powerful tool used to direct social and economic activity
in Canada.  The role that this "powerful
tool" may play in the prevention of the attainment of substantive equality
for women cannot be overlooked.  V.Statutory
Interpretation                     What type of
expense constitutes a business expense?  In order to rule on the meaning to be
given to the term "business expense" in the Act, the following
questions must be answered:  1What is the meaning of income from business or
property in s. 9?  2How do the limitations set out in s. 18(1) as
expenses made or incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing income
(paragraph (a), or as personal or living expenses (under paragraph (h),
affect this determination?  3Does s. 63 affect a taxpayer's ability to deduct
child care as a business expense?                      I do not agree
with my colleague Iacobucci J.'s reasons with regard to s. 63 of the Act, nor
to s. 15  of the Charter  and the eventual result he reaches.  I do,
however, substantially agree with the approach he has taken with regard to the
definition of "business expense" through ss. 9(1), 18(1)(a)
and 18(1)(h) of the Act and, as a result, I will not repeat a
similarly detailed analysis in this regard, but will only review the essential
points and provide my own insight into the two first questions at hand. In my
view, the logical conclusion to my colleague's analysis, although he does not
state it as such, is that ss. 9, 18(1)(a) and 18(1)(h) do not
prevent the deduction of child care expenses as a business expense. My
analysis, therefore, will focus primarily on the clear differences between our
two positions, specifically with respect to s. 63 of the Act.  A.Section
9 of the Income Tax Act:  The Ordinary Principles of Commercial Trading                            Before
embarking upon a detailed analysis of these questions, it is crucial to
recognize that the Canadian system of taxation is premised on taxation of
income based on source distinctions, pursuant to s. 3 of the Act, reproduced
above.  One such source of income is income from business, pursuant to
s. 3(a), and it is this source with which we are concerned in the
present appeal.                     Pursuant to s. 9(1)
of the Act, reproduced earlier, a taxpayer's income for a taxation year
from a business is the taxpayer's profit therefrom for the year. 
"Profit", although not defined in the Act, has been
interpreted to be a net concept.  The determination of "profit" is
dependent upon the question of whether an expenditure is a proper business
expense to be included in the calculation of such net gain (Daley v.
Minister of National Revenue, [1950] Ex. C.R. 516).  In order to arrive at
a calculation of net profit, the all-encompassing question one must ask is
whether a deduction is prohibited because it is not incurred for the purpose of
earning income as required by s. 18(1)(a), or because the expense is
personal pursuant to s. 18(1)(h).  It is my view, a view shared by my
colleague Iacobucci J., that this determination is essentially an examination
of the interplay between s. 9, which allows deductions, and the prohibition of
some of these potential deductions by ss. 18(1)(a) and (h).                      These two
significant criteria emerged in Cullen J.'s analysis of the case law for the
purposes of determining whether an expense may be deducted from business
income.  He held that:  (1) it must be in accordance with ordinary commercial
principles and business practice, having regard to the circumstances of each
case; and (2) it must be made or incurred for the purpose of gaining or
producing income from the business.  This test has been applied by this Court
in Mattabi Mines Ltd. v. Ontario (Minister of Revenue), [1988] 2 S.C.R.
175, in which Wilson J. asserted (at p. 189):  The
only thing that matters is that the expenditures were a legitimate expense made
in the ordinary course of business with the intention that the company
could generate a taxable income some time in the future. [Emphasis added.]  Such a broad strategy was adopted by
the trial judge, as well as by my colleague Iacobucci J.  Its main function is
to focus on a particular taxpayer and to consider what that taxpayer has
legitimately expended in order to do business.                     The Court of Appeal,
however, rejected this approach considering that "the concept of a
business expense has been developed exclusively in relation to the commercial
needs of the business, without any regard to the particular needs of those in
charge of the business" (p. 523).  As a result, Décary J.A. found that
child care expenses did not constitute a "business expense", since he
had "difficulty in seeing how a change in the particular needs of these
persons [businesspersons] could justify modifying an interpretation which has
nothing to do with these needs" (p. 523).  I cannot agree with the
approach taken by the Court of Appeal.  What, in my view, has traditionally
been recognized as a  "commercial need" has everything to do with
those persons who have traditionally held positions in the commercial sphere --
primarily men.  Further, a review of the developments in income tax legislation
and its interpretation clearly demonstrates that, as the needs of those
pursuing business have changed, the definition of what constitutes a business
expense has similarly expanded.   I will review some of these developments and
then, briefly, the foundation upon which the determination of these complex
questions must be made.  B.Section
18(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act: For the Purpose of Gaining or Producing Income
from Business                     There is a long
history of jurisprudence with respect to the meaning of this section, which my
colleague Iacobucci J. has thoroughly reviewed, and, as a result, I will not. 
What I do wish to re-emphasize, however, is that in Premium Iron Ores Ltd.
v. Minister of National Revenue, [1966] S.C.R. 685, at p. 702, this Court
contemplated the present wording of s. 18(1)(a).  Martland J., for the
Court, held that the wording change, from the earlier section which stated: "purpose
of earning the income", to the new one which provided for: "gaining
or producing income", was intended to broaden the definition of deductible
expenses.    My colleague speculates that this expansion is perhaps due to the
fact that, prior to subsequent amendments, deductions for capital intangibles
were unavailable other than through the general deduction provided for by the
predecessor of s. 18(1)(a) and, as such, an expansive view of s. 18(1)(a)
developed.  This expansive approach to s. 18(1)(a) may actually
demonstrate that the income tax system has had a long-standing capacity to
accommodate novel situations and developments, through the general sections
allowing deductions.  As my colleague points out, however, no test has any
greater certainty and clarity than that which is proclaimed by the precise
wording of the statute.  Therefore, the basic question which must be asked is
whether the appellant incurred child care expenses for the purpose of
gaining or producing income from business.                     At this time, I
would like to make a brief comment on the gendered analysis entangled in the
statutory interpretation in this case.  While it happens that the appellant is
a woman lawyer claiming child care expense deductions as a business expense, s.
9 of the Act is gender neutral.  Such a claim may also have been made by
a businessman in the same situation as Ms. Symes.  If such a businessman were,
for example,  the primary caretaker of his children, the rationale as well as
the end result would have been the same.  The ability to deduct a legitimate
business expense that one incurs in order to gain or produce income from
business should not be based on one's sex.  Any businessperson would be
entitled to a deduction if he or she can prove that such expenses have been
incurred for business purposes.  The reality, however, is that generally women,
rather than men, fulfil the role of sole or primary caregiver to children and,
as such, it is they alone who incur and pay for such expenses.  Men, until very
recently, have rarely been primary caregivers, nor single parents and, as a
result, they have not incurred direct child care expenses.  In many traditional
family situations child care issues were not concrete business expenses for men
in business, as most often their wives stayed home to care for their children
or made such child care arrangements.  Consequently, such a businessman would
have no basis on which to claim child care expenses as a business expense. 
However, in light of our changing society, in which men are being called upon
to bear a greater burden of child care responsibilities and expenses, which may
impede their ability to earn a profit, it is quite possible that businessmen
will accordingly be entitled to claim such expenses should they meet the criteria
for business expense deductions, as set out in s. 18(1)(a).  Regardless
of this future possibility, however, at this time the reality is that it is
primarily women who incur the cost, both social and financial, for child care
and this decision cannot, as such, ignore the contextual truth when examining
whether child care may be considered a business expense.                     As my colleague
asserts, child care expenses have traditionally been viewed as expenses that
were not incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing income, as they were
considered personal in nature and, accordingly, could not be regarded as
commercial. My colleague is of the view (at pp. 742-43) that:  ...
there is value in the traditional tax law test which seeks to identify
those expenses which simply make a taxpayer available to the business, and
which proceeds to classify such expenses as "personal" for the reason
that a "personal need" is being fulfilled. [Emphasis in original.]  In my view, such a test serves no
purpose.  The rationale of availability to the business is neither objective
nor determinative.  To be available for the business is the first requirement
of doing business, otherwise, there can be no business.  In this regard, it
would be unthinkable for a businessperson's special needs, for example those
associated with a disability, to be ineligible for deduction because they
satisfy a "personal need".  A woman's need for child care in order to
do business is no different.  One's personal needs can simply not be
objectively determined, they are by their very definition subjective.                     Courts in the past,
and the Court of Appeal in this case, have also always assumed that commercial
needs were an objectively neutral set of needs.  As a consequence, they did not
examine the close relationship between child care and women's business income. 
It is crucial, in my view, to examine the link between child care and the
generation of income from business, as did Cullen J.  After consideration of
the evidence of the expert witness Dr. Armstrong, the trial judge went on to
say (at p. 72):  ...
there has been a significant social change in the late 1970's and into the
1980's, in terms of the influx of women of child-bearing age into business and
into the workplace.  Dr. Armstrong testified that dramatic
and fundamental changes have been taking place in both the labour market and
the family structure over the past 40 years.  In 1951, only 24 percent of
Canadian women participated in the labour force.  By 1987, this number had
risen to 56 percent.  With respect to how the increase took place Dr. Armstrong
testified that:  It's
been quite rapid from the mid-'70s - early '70s on.  It was fairly slow to
increase in the '50s, but then the '60s, the acceleration was faster and it
increased in the '70s.  Further, the increase was most
dramatic for women in their childbearing years, with nearly three-quarters of
women between the ages of 16 and 44 being counted as members of the labour
force, particularly in the 1980s.  Today, a majority of women, even those with
very young children, are now in the labour force.  Fully 70 percent of employed
mothers with children younger than six years old work full time, as do
75 percent of employed mothers with school-age children (6 to 15 years). 
Current forecasts suggest that by the year 2000, fully 88 percent of women aged
25 to 34 years will be in the work force.  This increasing trend is
particularly noteworthy, since women aged 25 to 34 years are the group most
likely to have young children at home, thus requiring child care.  It is
evident that for most Canadian families, the issue of child care is of crucial
importance.                     It is with these
statistics and expert testimony in mind that we must consider whether child
care expenses can be accommodated within the definition of a business expense. 
In this regard, I agree with Cullen J.'s thoughtful and thorough analysis of
the complex issues in this case, which recognizes the evolution of our societal
structure and mandates that the interpretation of statutes be done in context,
not in a vacuum (Edmonton Journal v. Alberta (Attorney General), [1989]
2 S.C.R. 1326, at p. 1355).                     At the forefront of
this analysis are general and well known concepts of statutory interpretation,
for example, that the clear and unambiguous meaning of words which do not lead
to an unreasonable result must be followed and further, that the interpretation
of a law may change over time in order to coincide with an altered and
ever-changing societal context. (See E. A. Driedger, Construction of
Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 89, and P.-A. Côté, The Interpretation of
Legislation in Canada (2nd ed. 1991), at p. 227.)   Our Court has, in the
past, altered its interpretation of legislation in a number of cases to conform
with our changing social framework (see Murdoch v. Murdoch, [1975] 1
S.C.R. 423, Rathwell v. Rathwell, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 436, and, most
recently, Canada (Attorney General) v. Mossop, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 554). 
Furthermore, the respect of Charter  values must be at the forefront of
statutory interpretation (see Hills v. Canada (Attorney General), [1988]
1 S.C.R. 513, and Slaight Communications Inc. v. Davidson, [1989] 1
S.C.R. 1038).                     As I noted in Mossop,
supra, at p. 613, in Canadian National Railway Co. v. Canada
(Canadian Human Rights Commission), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1114 ("Action
Travail des Femmes"), Dickson C.J. reviewed the jurisprudence on the
interpretation of legislation and, at p. 1134, enunciated the following
principle:                     Human
rights legislation is intended to give rise, amongst other things, to
individual rights of vital importance, rights capable of enforcement, in the
final analysis, in a court of law.  I recognize that in the construction of
such legislation the words of the Act must be given their plain meaning, but it
is equally important that the rights enunciated be given their full recognition
and effect.  We should not search for ways and means to minimize those rights
and to enfeeble their proper impact.  Although it may seem commonplace, it
may be wise to remind ourselves of the statutory guidance given by the federal Interpretation
Act  which asserts that statutes are deemed to be remedial and are thus to
be given such fair, large and liberal interpretation as will best ensure that
their objects are attained. [Emphasis added.]  In my view, this approach is equally
apposite in the case at hand.   The provision for deduction pursuant to s. 9(1)
should also be given a "fair, large and liberal interpretation".                     In the past, the
scope of deductible business disbursements has been expanded constantly.  It
has been held to include a wide array of expenditures, such as club dues, meals
and entertainment expenses, car expenses, home office expenses, legal and
accounting fees, to name only a few.  In order that the expense the appellant claims
as a business expense be analyzed in the context of other "business
expenses", I will briefly examine some of the many deductions that have
been held to be legitimately expended for the purpose of gaining or producing
income from business.                     Section 18(12) of
the Act provides that a businessperson may deduct the expense of a home
office.  The test for the deduction of one's home office is, however, very
stringent.  The office must be used exclusively for the business, it must be
the taxpayer's principal place of business and it must be used regularly and
continuously, in order that the deduction be available.                     Self-employed
persons are also able to deduct 80 percent of their entertainment and meal
expenses that are expended for the purpose of gaining or producing income.
Section 67.1 of the Act limits the deductible portion of an expense in
recognition of the partly personal benefit which is received from these
expenses  (C. F. L. Young, "Case Comment on Symes v. The Queen",
[1991] Brit. Tax Rev. 105).                     With respect to
charitable donations, Olympia Floor & Wall Tile (Quebec) Ltd. v.
Minister of National Revenue, [1970] Ex. C.R. 274, and Impenco Ltd. v.
Minister of National Revenue, 88 D.T.C. 1242 (T.C.C.), clearly indicate
that some seemingly personal charitable donations may fall within the realm of
acceptable business deductions.  In both these cases, the companies donated
significant sums of money to charitable organizations in order to gain or
produce income.  That income, as they indicated, arose from the fact that those
with whom they did business were encouraged to purchase their product because
of their generally held reputation in the community that the company was extremely
generous toward charitable organizations.                     Other deductions
found to be business expenses are those incurred for legal and accounting fees
and damages.  In Kellogg Co. of Canada Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue,
[1942] C.T.C. 51 (Ex. Ct.), for example, the legal expenses incurred
through legal dealing with a trademark infringement were allowed as a deduction
incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing income.  Damages and fines,
according to Eva Krasa in "The Deductibility of Fines, Penalties, Damages,
and Contract Termination Payments" (1990), 38 Can. Tax J. 1399,
have also been allowed as business expenses on occasion.                     In Royal Trust
Co. v. Minister of National Revenue, 57 D.T.C. 1055, the Exchequer Court of
Canada held that the appellant trust company should be able to deduct club dues
and initiation fees paid on behalf of its executives and senior personnel.  The
court held that the evidence proved conclusively that the practice of paying
the club dues resulted in business from which the appellant gained or produced
income.                     In Friedland v.
The Queen, 89 D.T.C. 5341 (F.C.T.D.), the taxpayer was allowed to deduct
the expenses which he incurred for his Rolls Royce and BMW, to the extent that
these automobiles were used for business.                     Finally,
particularly relevant to the case at hand is the general recognition that the
concept of profit is a net calculation and, as such, it is clear that an
employer or a business may claim a deduction for employees' salaries and for
employer's contributions to an employee benefit package.  A daycare centre may
constitute such an employee benefit.  (See Kathleen Mahoney, "Daycare and
Equality in Canada" in Research Studies of the Commission on Equality
in Employment (1985), 157, at p. 166.)  In fact, as was set out by Cullen
J., at p. 70, with regard to business operations:                     There
is no dispute that salaries paid to employees are deductible as business
expenses, provided they are laid out to earn income and are reasonable. 
Further, under certain circumstances, wages or salaries paid to spouses or
children are also deductible as business expenses.  If this is so, the
plaintiff contends, why shouldn't the wages paid to the plaintiff's nanny be
deductible as a business expense?  Certainly, if the plaintiff hired a junior
lawyer or articling student whose duties also included looking after the
partner's children (if perhaps a daycare service was provided by the firm),
there would be no dispute that the wages of the junior or the articling student
would be deductible as a business expense.                      As is apparent, the
variety of allowable deductions has been expanded to a number of situations not
envisaged in earlier times to accommodate many diverse and new business
practices.  This development falls within principles of deductions which have
been succinctly reviewed by Neil Brooks in "The Principles Underlying the
Deduction of Business Expenses" in Hansen, Krishna and Rendall, eds., Essays
on Canadian Taxation (1978), 249.  The author notes that a number of tests
are used in order to determine what type of expense may be deducted as a
business expense.  These considerations include whether the expense is
deductible according to generally accepted accounting principles, whether the
expense is normally incurred by others in the particular business, whether the
expense would have been incurred by the taxpayer even if he or she had not been
earning income from a business, whether the taxpayer could have avoided the
expense without affecting gross income, as well as many other facts and
circumstances from which one may infer the taxpayer's purpose in incurring the
expense.  The multiplicity of tests, in my view, leaves it open for one to
conclude that any legitimate expense incurred in relation to a business may be
deducted as a business expense.  In fact, in this regard, Brooks confirms that
a judge's personal experience may strongly influence the conclusion that he or
she may reach as to whether a particular disbursement may be classified as a
business expense.  He writes (at p. 259):  Judges
know on the basis of their own experience that an expense incurred under certain
circumstances would be incurred by them for a personal purpose; they infer,
therefore, that it is probable that some other person, under similar
circumstances, would incur the expense for the same purpose.                     When we look at the
case law concerning the interpretation of "business expense", it is
clear that this area of law is premised on the traditional view of business as
a male enterprise and that the concept of a business expense has itself been
constructed on the basis of the needs of businessmen.  This is neither a
surprising nor a sinister realization, as the evidence well illustrates that it
has only been in fairly recent years that women have increasingly moved into
the world of business as into other fields, such as law and medicine.  The
definition of "business expense" was shaped to reflect the experience
of businessmen, and the ways in which they engaged in business. As
Dorothy Smith points out in "A Peculiar Eclipsing: Women's Exclusion From
Man's Culture" (1978), 1 Women's Studies Int. Quart. 281, when only
one sex is involved in defining the ideas, rules and values in a particular
domain, that one-sided standpoint comes to be seen as natural, obvious and
general. As a consequence, the male standard now frames the backdrop of
assumptions against which expenses are determined to be, or not to be,
legitimate business expenses.  Against this backdrop, it is hardly surprising
that child care was seen as irrelevant to the end of gaining or producing
income from business but rather as a personal non-deductible expense.                            As Cullen J.
recognized, the world of yesterday is not the world of today.  In 1993, the
world of business is increasingly populated by both men and women and
the meaning of "business expense" must account for the experiences of
all participants in the field.  This fact is enhanced by expert evidence which
indicates that the practices and requirements of businesswomen may, in fact,
differ from those of businessmen.  When we look at the current situation, it
becomes clear that one of the critical differences in the needs of businessmen
and businesswomen is the importance of child care for business people with
children, particularly women.  Cullen J., as confirmed by the expert evidence
before him, recognized that child care is vital to women's ability to earn an
income.  In this regard, I am wholly in agreement with Cullen J.'s conclusion
that it made "good business sense" for Ms. Symes to hire child care
and that this expense should come within the calculation of profit.   In my
view, Ms. Symes' child care expenses come within the definition of "the
purpose of gaining or producing income" and, as a result, are not
prevented by the wording of s. 18(1)(a) from deduction under s. 9(1).                     The second point,
to which I will now turn, is whether child care expenses may be disallowed as a
business expense pursuant to s. 18(1)(h) as being personal in nature.  C.Section
18(1)(h) of the Income Tax Act:  Personal or Living Expenses                     As previously
discussed, taxation logic allows deductions from gross income for legitimate
business expenses when calculating income.  Personal expenses are not, however,
seen as legitimate deductions.  These expenses are considered to be expenses of
"consumption" which should appropriately be included within the tax base. 
It is argued that child care is just such an expense, and that child bearing
and caring decisions are private decisions, having nothing to do with
business.  Under this logic, it is argued that Ms. Symes should not be granted
special or preferential treatment, by allowing her to deduct a personal expense
-- her child care cost. Although my colleague, Iacobucci J., has  examined this
issue,  I wish to express my own views with regard to what makes an expense
personal and whether child care qualifies as any other such expense.                     In my view, it is
important to look closely at the dichotomy of business as opposed to personal
expenses.   If we survey the experience of many men, it is apparent why it may
seem intuitively obvious to some of them that child care is  clearly within the
personal realm.   This conclusion may, in many ways, reflect many men's
experience of child care responsibilities.  In fact, the evidence before the
Court indicates that, for most men, the responsibility of children does not impact
on the number of hours they work, nor does it affect their ability to work. 
Further, very few men indicated that they made any work-related decisions on
the basis of child-raising responsibilities.  The same simply cannot currently
be said for women.  For women, business and family life are not so distinct
and, in many ways, any such distinction is completely unreal, since a woman's
ability to even participate in the work force may be completely contingent on
her ability to acquire child care.  The decision to retain child care is an
inextricable part of the decision to work, in business or otherwise.  This
reality is expressed by Grace Blumberg in  "Sexism in the Code: A
Comparative Study of Income Taxation of Working Wives and Mothers" (1971-1972),
21 Buff. L. Rev. 49, at p. 64, in similar terms:  Child
care ... is an expense ... which necessarily arises only when both parents are
employed.... A working mother's provision for child care is a nondiscretionary
expense directly related to the fact of her employment.                     In the recently
released study by the Canadian Bar Association Task Force on Gender Equality in
the Legal Profession entitled Touchstones for Change: Equality, Diversity
and Accountability (1993), the difficulties many women lawyers face when
attempting to balance career and family were highlighted.  The report states
(at p. 65):                     One
of the main causes of discrimination against women lawyers is the culture that
surrounds work in the legal profession.  That culture has been shaped by and
for male lawyers.  It is predicated on historical work patterns that assume
that lawyers do not have significant family responsibilities.  The "hidden
gender" of the current arrangements for legal work manifests itself in
many ways, including: the extremely long and irregular hours of work;
assumptions about the availability of domestic labour to support a lawyer's
activities at work; promotion within law firms which is incompatible with the
child bearing and child rearing cycles of most women's lives; and the perceived
conflict between allegiances owed to work and family.  Particularly with respect to child
care responsibilities, provincial surveys provided clear evidence that women
lawyers bear by far a greater responsibility for child care than do their male
counterparts, at p. 67:  The
proportion of responsibility borne by women lawyers for their children is
almost double that borne by male lawyers.  When
asked about the proportion of responsibility they bear, women responded 49%
(Ontario); 40% (British Columbia) and 44% (Alberta) while men responded 26%
(Ontario); 20% (British Columbia); and 26% (Alberta).  The
Saskatchewan survey revealed that women assume primary responsibility for child
care in all areas broken down by activity.  For example, 59% of women report
they care for children when the latter are ill compared to only 4% of men.  Further, the surveys revealed that
women lawyers had a much greater reliance on paid child care workers than did
male lawyers, at pp. 67-68:  Women
lawyers are much more likely to rely on paid child care givers than are male
lawyers -- by a ratio of three to one.  In
Ontario, female respondents identified the proportion of responsibility borne
by paid child care workers as 26%, while men responded 10%.  In British
Columbia the proportion of child care responsibility borne by paid child care
workers was reported as 26% by women lawyers and 10% by men.  Again, in
Alberta, this proportion was 29% for female lawyers and 8% for male lawyers.  In
the Saskatchewan and Quebec surveys, 70% of women reported having the
responsibility for making child care arrangements.  Conversely,
male lawyers can count on a spouse or spousal equivalent to be responsible for
child care at a rate of approximately three times the spousal assistance
available to women.                                                                     .
. .  Although
both male and female lawyers have experienced stress as a result of competing
demands of career and child care responsibilities, women reported negative
material effects in the form of loss of income or reduced career opportunities
to a degree not reported by men.  For
example, a majority of women reported loss of income due to child rearing
whereas only a small minority of men did so. [Emphasis in original.]                     The reality of Ms.
Symes' business life necessarily includes child care. The 1993 concept of
business expense must include the reality of diverse business practices and
needs of those who have not traditionally participated fully in the world of
business.  Décary J.A.'s statement that the "concept of a business expense
has been developed ... without any regard to the particular needs of those in
charge of the business" (p. 523), fails to recognize this reality.  In
this regard, comments made by Isabel Grant and Lynn Smith in a paper prepared
for the Ontario Law Reform Commission ("Gender Representation in the
Canadian Judiciary", in Appointing Judges: Philosophy, Politics and
Practice (1991), 57, at p. 79) ring true:  ...
no one is "objective" in the sense of being without a frame of
reference, yet we sometimes fail to notice the frame of reference of those who
have been in a position to define the very terms and concepts in which we
think.                     Audrey Macklin in
"Symes v. M.N.R.: Where Sex Meets Class" (1992), 5 C.J.W.L.
498, at p. 507, retorted that Décary J.A.'s  above assertion:  ...
failed to acknowledge that as long as business has been the exclusive domain of
men, the commercial needs of business have been dictated by what men (think
they) need to expend in order to produce income.  The fact that these
expenditures also have a "personal" element was never treated as a
complete bar.  Thus, the courts have in the past permitted businessmen to
deduct club fees because men like to conduct business with each other over
golf. [Royal Trust Co. v. Minister of National Revenue, supra] ...
Because some men believe expensive cars enhance their professional image,
driving a Rolls Royce has been held to be an incident of a professional
business. [Friedland v. The Queen, supra.]  As a consequence, one must ask whether
the many business deductions available, for cars, for club dues and fees, for
lavish entertainment and the wining and dining of clients and customers, and
for substantial charitable donations, are so obviously business expenses rather
than personal ones.  Although potentially personal, each one of these expenses
has been accepted as a legitimate business expense and, as each reflects a real
cost incurred by certain kinds of business people to produce income from
business, a deduction has been allowed.  The real costs incurred by
businesswomen with children are no less real, no less worthy of consideration
and no less incurred in order to gain or produce income from business.                     Finally, with
regard to the potentially personal nature of child care expenses, the issue of
"choice" has been raised as a barrier to the availability of a
deduction.  As I am in agreement with my colleague Iacobucci J.'s reasoning in
this regard, I will make only a few brief points.  While there is a personal
component to child raising, and while the care of children may be personally
rewarding, this "choice" is a choice unlike any others.  This
"choice" is one from which all of society benefits, yet much of the
burden remains on the shoulders of women.  Women "choose" to
participate in an activity which is not for their benefit alone, and, in so
doing, they undertake a function on behalf of all society.  As Dickson C.J.
very appropriately remarked in Brooks v. Canada Safeway Ltd., [1989] 1
S.C.R. 1219, at p. 1243:  That
those who bear children and benefit society as a whole thereby should not be
economically or socially disadvantaged seems to bespeak the obvious.  It is
only women who bear children; no man can become pregnant.... it is unfair to
impose all of the costs of pregnancy upon one half of the population.  The decision to have children is not like
any other "consumption" decision.  To describe the raising of
children in comparable terms to "choosing" to purchase a certain kind
of automobile or live in a certain dwelling is simply untenable.  As well, the
many complexities surrounding child care make it inappropriate to adopt the
language of voluntary assumption of costs, where those costs may, in fact, be
allocated in a discriminatory fashion -- the burden falling primarily on women.                     In conclusion to
the question of whether child care expenses are precluded from being deducted
as a business expense under s. 9(1) by the interplay of either s. 18(1)(a)
or s. 18(1)(h) of the Act, I answer that child care may be held
to be a business expense deductible pursuant to ss. 9(1), 18(1)(a) and
18(1)(h) of the Act, all other criteria being respected.  This
result leads me to the  most crucial consideration in this appeal, that is
whether s. 63 of the Act precludes the deduction of child care expenses
as a business expense.  Here, I part company with my colleague since, in my
view, s. 63 of the Act, properly interpreted, is no such bar.  D.Section
63 of the Income Tax Act                     (i)Overview                     Section 63 of the Act,
reproduced earlier, provides a limited deduction for child care expenses. 
The deduction is available, in most circumstances, to the lower income earning
spouse in a family unit.  It is a non-source-based deduction available to all
parents.  At trial, the effect of s. 63 was not argued at length since, as
Cullen J. briefly noted (at p. 75):  . .
. the defendant [respondent] has admitted that if the nanny expense is a proper
business expense pursuant to sections 3, 9 and 18 of the Act, then section 63 cannot
prevent it from being allowed as such.  On appeal, however, the MNR withdrew
this admission and the relevance of s. 63 became of much greater import.  Décary
J.A. for the Court of Appeal concluded that s. 63 was a complete code, and
precluded the deduction of anything more than the limits set out.  Thus, even
if child care had the potential to be construed as a business expense, which he
did not find, s. 63 foreclosed this possibility.  My colleague adopts the same
view. I disagree.                     Computation of
income under the Act is, as already indicated, based on the concept of
income from source.   Section 3 of the Act, to which I have referred
earlier in these reasons, provides that, in computing income for a taxation
year, a taxpayer must compute the income from each source from which the income
is received and the aggregate of each is the total income.  In this case, we
are concerned only with income from one source: the business.  According to s.
3 of the Act, after calculating income, a taxpayer must compute and
subtract any deductions allowed under subdivision e of Division B --
Computation of Income.  It is in this calculation that a s. 63 deduction is
taken into account.  Subdivision e differs from deductions allowable under
subdivisions a, b and c, which are each concerned only with a particular source
of income.  According to s. 4(2) of the Act, the s. 63 deduction is not
applicable either wholly or in part to a particular source of income. The
argument of the respondent rests on the proposition that the availability of
deductions under s. 63 is incompatible with the availability of child care
deductions pursuant to s. 9(1).  In other words, the mere existence of s. 63
prevents any deduction for child care under s. 9(1) of the Act.                     My answer is
twofold.  First, there is nothing in the wording of s. 63 that overrides the
application of s. 9. Second, such an interpretation is, in my view, in
contradiction with the purpose and historical basis for the enactment of s. 63,
with traditional approaches to diverse deductions under the Act and,
finally, with the Charter .  Since its inception, the Act has been
extensively interpreted.  In Stubart Investments Ltd. v. The Queen,
[1984] 1 S.C.R. 536, Estey J. writing for the Court held at p. 578, quoting
Driedger, Construction of Statutes, supra, at p. 87, that:                     Today
there is only one principle or approach, namely, the words of an Act are to be
read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense
harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the
intention of Parliament.  I suggest that, in this light, many of
the same questions, that were examined with regard to the above analysis of ss.
9(1), 18(1)(a) and 18(1)(h), must take place in the context of s.
63.  Just as these sections of the Act have developed with regard solely
to the needs of a traditionally male practice of business, so has the history
of s. 63 been tainted by a specific view of the world.  In this regard, the
following comment by Oliver Wendell Holmes in The Common Law (1881), at
p. 1, rings as true today, in the context of judicial reasoning with respect to
income tax legislation, as it did in 1881, with respect to the development of
the common law:  The
life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience.  The felt
necessities of the time, the prevalent moral and political theories, intuitions
of public policy, avowed or unconscious, even the prejudices which judges share
with their fellow-men, have had a good deal more to do than the syllogism in
determining the rules by which men should be governed.  Recognition that laws are not neutral
is not new.  As the interpretation of "business expense" has been shown
to be wrought with male perspective and subjectivity, so is an interpretation
of business expense that is limited by s. 63 of the Act.  Section 63 was
implemented in order to adapt to the needs of a society at that time.  In 1972,
when that section was enacted, societal ideals with regard to equality of the
sexes and the equal participation of women in all aspects of society had not
evolved to the point where they have today.  Now, in 1993, as we approach the
interpretation of laws, one hopes, as is observed by Joan Brockman in
"Social Authority, Legal Discourse, and Women's Voices" (1992), 21 Man.
L.J. 213, at p. 233, that "[t]he myth of law's neutrality has been
largely eroded."  An interpretation which holds that s. 63 prevents the
deduction of child care costs which would otherwise constitute a valid business
expense is guided, in my opinion, by the myth of neutrality, a matter I will
now examine.                     (ii)Section
63 Interplay with Section 9(1)                     According to my
colleague and, for that matter, Décary J.A., since the wording of s. 63 of the Act
clearly includes the appellant's nanny expenses, s. 63 acts as a complete
bar, rendering the appellant Symes ineligible to deduct her child care expenses
as a business expense.  I do not interpret s. 63 of the Act in such a
fashion.  Sections 63 and 9(1), in my view, may co-exist.  The fact that
Parliament enacted a section to benefit all parents in the paid work force
without distinction does not prevent a taxpayer who is in business from
deducting an expense which can be legitimately claimed as a business expense. 
Section 63 provides general relief to parents, but nothing in its wording
implies that deductions available under s. 9(1) are abolished or restricted in
this respect.  Had Parliament intended to submit the deduction of child care
expenses to the application of s. 63 it would have expressed it in clear
language.  In providing that none of the deductions permitted by ss. 60 to 63
are applicable to a particular source of income, s. 4(2) of the Act clearly
provides for some deductions which may legitimately fall under two sections of
the Act.  In addition, it is not insignificant that the text of s. 63 is
permissive as opposed to the negative wording of ss. 18(1)(b) and 18(1)(e),
which are clearly intended to limit the allowable deductions to only those
permitted under these paragraphs.  Finally, it is important to note that the
taxpayer in this case is not seeking to claim a s. 63 deduction from a source,
but is seeking a source deduction, independent of the s. 63 deduction for child
care, for a business expense.                     The appellant
argues that the availability of a deduction for child care expenses is
consistent with principles of income tax as accepted in Olympia Floor &
Wall Tile (Quebec) Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, supra
(followed in Impenco Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, supra). 
In Olympia, the taxpayer was allowed to deduct, as a business expense,
moneys which it had donated to charity for the purpose of gaining or producing
income from business.  The court held that such a deduction was not prohibited
under what is now s. 9 of the Act by the fact that it could also have
been allowed under s. 27(1) of the Act.  My colleague distinguishes Olympia,
supra, in that the deduction there allowed is of a different order than
that claimed in the case at hand.  There, the taxpayer argued that the expense
had been incurred for two distinct purposes, while, in the case at hand, only
one purpose is argued.  This, in my view, has absolutely no bearing on the
interpretation of s. 63, contrary to the view of my colleague.  While it is
true that the taxpayer in this case has claimed only that the child care
expenses she has incurred are in order to gain or produce income from her
business, the rationale in both cases is the same and the cases cannot be
distinguished with any significance.  Jackett P.'s comments are apposite here
and, as a consequence,  I will cite the following extract from his reasons at
length (at pp. 282 and 284):                     Ordinarily,
one thinks of charity as a personal matter.  One gives of what one would
otherwise have for oneself for the relief of poverty in others or for education
or other "good works".  In its original concept, therefore, one would
not deduct a charitable gift in computing one's profit or income because it is,
by definition, a gift made out of the profit or income after it is earned.
Quite clearly, I should have thought, in its inception, a gift to charity was a
"personal" outlay, the deduction of which would have been prohibited
by the forerunner of section 12(1)(h).                                                                      ...                     While
hitherto unforeseen, however, I can find no inherent incompatibility between an
"outlay ... for the purpose of ... producing income" and a gift to a
charitable organization.  If, on the facts of a particular case, such a gift is
found to have been made  bona fide,  as an outlay for the purpose of
producing income, I am of the view that, prima facie, it escapes the
prohibition in section 12(1)(a).                     There
remains for consideration the question whether, when section 27(1)(a) is
read with the other provisions of the Act, one must reach the conclusion that
Parliament intended that gifts to charitable organizations were not to be
deducted except in the manner and to the extent authorized by that provision. 
In other words, must one infer from the existence of section 27(1)(a) a
prohibition against any deduction of charitable contributions in the
computation of income?                                                                      ...  In
my view, when a taxpayer makes an outlay for the purpose  of producing income
-- i.e. as part of his profit making process -- even though that outlay
takes the form of a "gift" to a charitable organization, it is not a
"gift" within the meaning of that word in section 27(1)(a)
which, by reason of the place it holds in the process of computing taxable
income, was obviously intended to confer a benefit on persons who made
contributions out of income and was not intended to provide deductions
for outlays made in the course of the income earning process. [Emphasis in
original.]  Both Olympia and Impenco,
supra, recognize that some people do business differently and incur
different expenses than those traditionally viewed as business expenses.  In Olympia
and Impenco, the particular practices of Jewish businessmen were
recognized. In this case, it is the particular situation of a businesswoman
which is at stake.  In principle, and according to the rationale which
underlies s. 9 of the Act, the two situations are similar.  The fact
that s. 63 may be available to others or to the same taxpayer who would prefer
to claim the deductions under that section does not in any way impede the
application of s. 9, which clearly applies to business expenses.                     Further, even if
the case at hand could be distinguished, as my colleague suggests, I find that
these cases advance, rather than negate, the proposition that even when one's
deductions seemingly fall under one section of the Act, this does not
render such expenses inadmissible for a different purpose covered under another
section of the Act.  In fact, there are a number of instances under the Act
where a taxpayer may claim a deduction under more than one section of the Act
for an expense incurred for a single purpose.  Tuition deductions may be
deducted under the section for tuition expenses or under general business
expenses incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing income.  As Professor
Woodman, in "A Child Care Expenses Deduction, Tax Reform and the Charter :
Some Modest Proposals" (1990), 8 Can. J. Fam. L. 371, suggests at
p. 377, footnote 30,  "a businessperson can deduct tuition fees that may
or may not fall within the tuition fee provisions of ITA sec. 118.5 (now a tax
credit but formerly a deduction in ITA sec. 60)".   As well, expenses
incurred by a salesperson may be deducted, according to the wording of the Act,
under multiple sections, ss. 8(1) (f), (h), 8(9)  and 18(1)(l).                     Regardless of
whether the many factors I have set out above are determinative, certainly
these many considerations lead one to the conclusion that, at the very least,
s. 63 is ambiguous in its effect on s. 9(1).  In such circumstances one must
resort, as did Cullen J., to the general rules of statutory interpretation
which make it clear that ambiguities are to be resolved in favour of the
taxpayer.  In Johns-Manville Canada Inc. v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R.
46, at p. 72, Estey J. stated:                     The
characterization in taxation law of an expenditure is, in the final analysis
(unless the statute is explicit which this one is not), one of policy.... Such
a determination is, furthermore, consistent with another basic concept in tax
law that where the taxing statute is not explicit, reasonable uncertainty or
factual ambiguity resulting from lack of explicitness in the statute should be
resolved in favour of the taxpayer.  This residual principle must be the
more readily applicable in this appeal where otherwise annually recurring
expenditures, completely connected to the daily business operation of the
taxpayer, afford the taxpayer no credit against tax either by way of capital
cost or depletion allowance with reference to a capital expenditure, or an
expense deduction against revenue. [Emphasis added.]                     Professor Woodman, supra,
at p. 377, expresses the view, however, that Estey J.'s statement was directed
only to an income tax system that failed to recognize capital expenditures. 
Independent of the particular facts of that case, the basic concept in tax law
that ambiguities should be resolved in favour of the taxpayer is an accepted
one.  Applying, if need be, this rule of statutory interpretation to the
present situation, in the absence of precise and clear wording in the Act with
regard to the effect of s. 63 on s. 9(1), general child care expenses which
might be deductible under s. 63 may coexist with child care expenses deductible
as a business expense.  Richard B. Thomas in "No to Nanny Expense
Deduction" (1991), 39 Can. Tax J. 950, at p. 953, underlines this
ambiguity:    In
our view, the Crown's admission at the trial level was probably correct -- the
existence of section 63 should not determine whether the child care expenses in
question are a business expense for the purposes of paragraph 18(1)(a).  At
best, the existence of section 63 might, on an object-and-spirit approach to
the scheme of the Act, suggest that Parliament assumed that child care expenses
were not deductible business expenses.  Deductions under s. 63 of the Act,
as opposed to business expense deductions, clearly require that different
criteria be met for one to be eligible for the deduction under one or the other
section.  In addition, each has its own purpose.  Working parents, to whom the
deduction under s. 63 applies, would not be eligible for any such deduction had
s. 63 not been enacted.  Businesspersons, however, may be eligible to deduct
child care as they would any other business expense, provided they were able to
meet the requirements for a deduction under ss. 9 and 18 of the Act. 
However, there may be many parents who own businesses who may not be able to
meet these requirements and the deduction under s. 63 would, thus, be available
to them.                     Finally, in this
regard, one must not lose track of the fact that s. 63, which is general in
nature, was drafted at a time when, as discussed by Iacobucci J., child care
expenses were considered an entirely personal expense.  When Parliament enacted
s. 63, a new benefit, not then allowed under any other section of the Act,
was conferred on taxpayers generally in order to better the position of working
parents in society.  From this perspective, it seems obvious that Parliament
could not have intended to prohibit the deduction of child care as a business
expense.  To conclude that s. 63 intends to limit the opportunity for a
businesswoman to deduct child care expenses is antithetical to the whole
purpose of the legislation, which was aimed at helping working women and their
families bear the high cost of child care.   A review of the history and the
purpose of the enactment sheds some light in this regard.                     (iii)Historical
and Purposive Perspective                     Iacobucci J. refers
to the proposals that led to the introduction of s. 63 in 1972, and is
"not impressed by the suggestion that Parliament intended s. 63 to limit
deductibility only for employees" (p. 750).  Although, like him,  I find
the history of s. 63 very telling, I draw a very different conclusion from the
analysis.                     The 1966 report of
the Carter Commission recommended that tax credits for working mothers be
instituted (Report of the Royal Commission on Taxation, vol. 3, Taxation
of Income: Part A - Taxation of Individuals and Families (1966), at p. 19). 
Six years later, in 1972, s. 63 formed part of a tax reform package, in which
Parliament extended to employees a number of new deductions.  After noting that
six out of seven Canadian taxpayers earn wages or salaries, a limited deduction
for child care expenses, together with a number of other employee deductions
for tools and travelling expenses, was announced by E. J. Benson the then
Minister of Finance in Proposals for Tax Reform (1969), at p. 10, para.
1.33, as follows:                     Costs
of looking after young children when both parents are working, or when there is
only one parent and that parent is working, would be allowed as a deduction
subject to certain conditions.  This new plan is intended primarily to benefit
mothers who need to work to support their families.... [Emphasis added.]  Benson, as quoted by Iacobucci J.,
further noted supra, at p. 15, paras. 2.7 and 2.9:                     We
propose to permit deduction of the child care expenses that face many working
parents today.  The problem of adequately caring for children when both parents
are working, or when there is only one parent in the family and she or he is
working, is both a personal and a social one.  We consider it desirable on
social as well as economic grounds to permit a tax deduction for child care expenses,
under carefully controlled terms, in addition to the general deduction for
children.                                                                      ...                     This
new deduction for child care costs would be a major reform.  While it is not
possible to make an accurate forecast of the number who would benefit from this
new deduction, it seems likely to be several hundred thousand families.  It
would assist many mothers who work or want to work to provide or supplement the
family income, but are discouraged by the cost of having their children cared
for.  The deduction available under s. 63
has consistently been described in relation to employed mothers as a "special
tax allowance to working mothers" (House of Commons Standing Committee on
Finance, Trade and Economic Affairs, Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence,
June 23, 1970, at p. 70:145).                     It is not
insignificant that, as discussed earlier, the number of women in the work force
in 1972 was ostensibly less than it is today and the number of women who were
in business was minimal.  It is highly probable that the legislators did not
even put their mind to the fact that women may some day enter into  business and
the professions in large numbers and that these women may approach the world of
business differently than did their male predecessors.  Most importantly, it
was certainly not within the legislators' frame of mind that child care would
be viewed as anything other than a personal expense.                     Secondly, I wish to
address the concern raised by many commentators, including my colleague
Iacobucci J., that to allow child care expenses to be deducted as a business
expense would defeat and undermine the purpose of the provision of s. 63, to
allow a general deduction of child care expenses to all parents, whether
employed or self-employed.  Clearly, this analysis is very much tied to the
purpose one attaches to the legislation.   In a very thoughtful response to these
concerns, Audrey Macklin, supra, notes that, even under the s. 63
deduction, the more income a person has and, consequently, the higher tax
bracket one falls into, the higher the deduction available.  This fact also
undermines the goal of equity.  Further, the concern that employed persons and
business people will not be treated in the same manner is a fact which stems
from the rationale of the Act itself; business deductions generally are
restricted to those in business and are not available to an employed person. 
An employee cannot deduct an office at home,  car expenses, meal and
entertainment expenses, nor club dues or fees.  In addition, employers who hire
staff can deduct their salaries and employers who provide day care for their
employees may deduct the expense (D. Goodison, "Nanny Means
Business", CGA Magazine, September 1989, 15).  Employees enjoy no
such comparable deductions.                     As my colleague has
indicated, our tax system is based on principles of horizontal and vertical
equity.  The former requires that we tax individuals in similar circumstances
the same, while the latter focuses on the similar taxation of individuals in
different circumstances.  These are important objectives and were recognized as
of the highest priority in the Report of the Royal Commission on Taxation,
supra.  The Carter Commission stated in vol. 2, at p. 17:                     We
assign a higher priority to the objective of equity than to all the others....
our task requires us to make recommendations that would lead to an equitable
distribution of the burden of taxation.  We are convinced that unless this
objective is achieved to a high degree all other achievements are of little
account. Thus the need for an equitable tax system has been our major concern
and has guided us in all our deliberations.  At the same time as we value equity
under the income tax system, however, it is apparent that the system creates
and perpetuates many inequalities.  As Professor Claire Young notes,  supra,
at pp. 108-9:                     Income
tax legislation is, by its very nature, both overtly and systemically
discriminatory.  For example, in Canada, the Act discriminates in favour of
Canadian residents and against non-residents by imposing higher rates of tax on
some forms of income realised by the latter.  It discriminates in favour of the
self-employed and against employees by allowing the self-employed a greater
range of deductions from income.  It discriminates in favour of investors in
equity and against investors in debt by taxing capital gains at a lower rate
than interest income and giving every resident a lifetime exemption from tax on
$100,000 of capital gains.  The basic premise upon which
discussion with respect to the differential treatment between employees and
businesspersons must be laid is the recognition that the Act can be
viewed to operate in a discriminatory fashion.  While the Act may never
have attempted to maintain equilibrium between persons in business and those
who are employed, one must recognize that the realities of doing business
cannot be ignored.  Employees do not incur overhead expenses while businesses
do.  Employees are not able to deduct any expenses that they incur in order to
work because their income is based on their gross salary, whereas business
income is based on the calculation of the net profit or gain of the business. 
As a result, deductions are a regular occurrence.  What constitutes a business
expense for tax purposes is not cast immutably in stone.  The concept of
business expense should be interpreted in a way that takes into account the
realities of businesswomen's expenses in relation to child care.  However, in
recognizing the distinction between the treatment of employees and
businesspersons under the Act, in no way am I indicating that this may
not constitute a real difficulty within our taxation system.                     This said, this
case is most fundamentally not about the many vertical inequities that may
exist, but rather a question of horizontal equity and the need to treat all
businesspersons alike.  Further, the fact that the government has provided that
a deduction for child care expenses be available to all parents, including
employed persons, who ordinarily enjoy very few deductions, indicates
governmental recognition that child care is a legitimate expense of working parents,
in particular mothers.  Finally, we must not assume that most self-employed
entrepreneurs, whom the Act favours, are multi-millionaires -- they are
not, as the evidence of Dr. Armstrong demonstrates.  Dr. Armstrong indicated
that self-employed women generally work in small businesses of three to four
persons.  Their businesses are mostly in the service sector, where, if they are
not physically present at the work site, the business could not operate, for
example: beauty salons, shops, doctors, lawyers, caterers, etc.  As a result of
long hours and the requirement to work at the place of business, rather than at
home, child care needs are extremely critical for these women.  Businesswomen
and, for that matter, men who legitimately incur child care expenses for the
purpose of gaining or producing income from business must not be deprived of
the benefit of a business deduction for their expenses.                     Finally, on a
technical point, my colleague suggests that allowing a deduction for child care
expenses may result in the distribution of child care responsibility becoming
more of an "accounting measure" than a reality -- a fictitious
creation in order to ensure that the self-employed spouse be eligible to deduct
child care as a business expense.  This determination, in my view, is not,
however, sufficiently problematic to justify disallowing child care deductions
as a business expense.  First, the taxpayer, as for any other expense, will
have to prove that child care is necessary for her or him to gain or produce
income from business and, in this connection, will be required to indicate to
what extent the taxpayer is responsible for child care.  Such scrutiny is
really no different from the procedure which the MNR undertakes to determine
the deductibility of home office expenses and numerous other expenses.  E.Conclusion
on Statutory Interpretation of the Income Tax Act                     In conclusion, ss.
63 and 9(1) of the Act may, in my view, co-exist.  There is nothing in
the wording of s. 63 that excludes the application of s. 9. In addition, any
such interpretation is contrary to the purpose and historical basis for the
enactment of s. 63 and to traditional approaches to diverse deductions under
the Act.  In any analysis involving the examination of the interplay
between ss. 9(1) and 63, one cannot overlook the effect of an interpretation
which concludes that s. 63 overrides the possibility of a business deduction
for child care.  Although apparently neutral, such an interpretation may be
shaped by a selective perspective.  Though legislators, no doubt, strive toward
objectivity, laws are inevitably drafted on the basis of the law makers' own
vision of society and their own experience, experience which leads them to
perceive certain interpretations and results as being obvious or neutral. 
However, different realities may give rise to different meanings, as Margrit
Eichler notes in Nonsexist Research Methods: A Practical Guide (1988),
at p. 78:  So
long as the social positions of males and females are significantly different,
it will be necessary to recognize that a given situation may have very
different meanings and implications for the members of each sex.  The definition of a business expense
under the Act has evolved in a manner that has failed to recognize the
reality of businesswomen. It is thus imperative to recognize that any
interpretation of s. 63 which prevents the deduction of child care as a
business expense may, in fact, be informed by this partisan perspective.                     Finally, as
mentioned earlier, besides relying on the statute presently under examination,
one must not lose sight of the fact that the values enshrined in the Charter 
must inform such interpretation:  Hills v. Canada (Attorney General),
supra, and Slaight Communications Inc. v. Davidson, supra. 
Since, in my view, either the Act permits the deduction of child care
expenses as a business expense or it is ambiguous, one must, contrary to my
colleague's view, examine that ambiguity through the prism of the values
enshrined in the Charter  and, in particular, in ss. 15  and 28 .  These
sections encompass and embrace the importance and significance of equality
between the sexes and the Act must be interpreted in a manner that does
not run contrary to, but rather enhances, these principles.  In this regard,
when ensuring that laws conform with the imperatives of the Charter , it
is important to consider whether a situation or law has different implications
for men and women.  To disallow child care as a business expense clearly has a
differential impact on women and we cannot simply pay lip service to equality
and leave intact an interpretation which privileges businessmen, and which
continues to deny the business needs of businesswomen with children.  In my
view, consideration of the Charter  values when interpreting the Act strengthens
the conclusion that Ms. Symes should be able to deduct her child care expenses
as a business expense.                     Since I have
reached the conclusion that, on the basis of statutory interpretation,  Ms.
Symes is entitled to deduct her child care expenses as a business expense
pursuant to ss. 9(1), 18(1)(a) and (h) and 63 of the Act, the
constitutional questions do not have to be answered.  However, since my
colleague, Iacobucci J., has raised many areas of concern and difficulty with
respect to the effect and application of s. 15  of the Charter  on the Act,
I wish to make the following comments.  VI.The
Charter : Section 15                     My colleague,
Iacobucci J., has set out the basic principles of Charter  analysis,
particularly with respect to s. 15  and the rights guaranteed by s. 15 .  I
strongly agree that equality "is an elusive concept" (Andrews,
supra, at p. 164) and that s. 15(1)  guarantees much more than formal
equality.  The goal of s. 15 , with regard to gender, is the attainment of true
substantive equality between men and women and, as a consequence, the value of
equality as enshrined in the Charter  must be given considerable weight
in the case at hand.                     Contrary to my
colleague, however, I believe that an interpretation which prevents Ms. Symes
from deducting her child care expenses as a business expense under the Act results
in an infringement of her right to equality pursuant to s. 15  of the Charter .  
There are a number of points made by my colleague, as well as by the Court of
Appeal, on which I feel it necessary to comment.  These include a focus on s.
63 of the Act rather than on business deductions as a whole, whether the
actual cost incurred by Ms. Symes has been proven or if this is even necessary,
and whether this case raises the question of the cost incurred by all
women as a consequence of child care and not, simply, businesswomen.  I will
deal with each in turn.                     My colleague
focuses his Charter  analysis primarily on s. 63.  He suggests that one
must examine whether the appellant has proven that she has suffered
discrimination as a result of the effect of s. 63 of the Act.  In order
to satisfy this test, according to him,  Ms. Symes must prove that "s. 63
disproportionately limits the deduction with respect to actual expenses
incurred by women" and that "proof that women pay social costs is not
sufficient proof that women pay child care expenses" (p. 7650).  I beg to
differ.  Such inference is, in my view, inescapable and, further, in this case,
it was proven that Ms. Symes did incur the expenses for which she claims the
deduction.                     Such inference is
part and parcel of a recognition that child care responsibilities present a
significant obstacle for women in the social and economic domain, that this
issue is an equality issue and that the interpretation of legislation can and
must accommodate equality and the changing realities of our society.  According
to Edward J. McCaffery, in "Taxation and the Family:  A Fresh Look at
Behavioral Gender Biases in the Code" (1993), 40 UCLA L. Rev. 983,
at pp. 987-88:  ...
tax laws contribute to the marginalization of women in the workplace, and
impede a more creative formulation of alternative models of work and family. 
Major, structural aspects of the tax laws were put in place at a time when
traditional families -- meaning households with men working outside, and women
working inside, the home -- were dominant.  These aspects persist to this day,
serving as an anchor against the emergence of more modern and flexible family
models. [Footnotes omitted.]  This is the reality in which Ms. Symes
lives -- as a lawyer and as a mother.  A reality in which she suffers
disproportionately to men and, as such, is discriminated against on the basis
of her sex.  She has proven that she has incurred an actual and calculable
price for child care and that this cost is disproportionately incurred by
women.                     The fact that Ms.
Symes has to compare herself to businessmen is not, in my view, a return to the
similarly situated test.  As McIntyre J. indicates of equality, in Andrews,
supra, at p. 164:  It
is a comparative concept, the condition of which may only be attained or
discerned by comparison with the condition of others in the social and
political setting in which the question arises.  We cannot ignore the reality that Ms.
Symes is a businesswoman, but neither can this be taken as a return to a test,
which has been described by Catharine A. MacKinnon in "Reflections on Sex
Equality Under Law" (1991), 100 Yale L.J. 1281, at p. 1297, as
follows:  Designed
for the exceptional individual whose biography approximates the male one, this
approach cannot touch the situation of most women, where the force of social
inequality effectively precludes sex comparisons.                     Ms. Symes is asking
that she be treated equally, independently of her sex, under the Act.  She
has provided ample evidence that women suffer the social cost of child care and
that the expense of child care which she incurs, and has paid, is not a purely
personal expense but is incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing income
from business.  In my view, Ms. Symes suffers an actual and calculable loss as
a result of not being able to deduct a legitimate business expense which she
incurs.  The goal and the requirement of equality, as set out by s. 15  of the Charter ,
makes it unacceptable that Ms. Symes be denied the right to deduct her business
expenses merely because such expenses are not generally incurred by
businessmen.  Denial of these deductions would constitute discrimination under
the Act.                     Iacobucci J.
suggests that the dilemma should not be framed as a business deduction but,
rather, as an issue of the cost of child care that is placed on all women
whether employed or self-employed.  In this regard, he quotes Professor Audrey
Macklin, supra, at p. 512, who states:  If
the goal of section 15  in this context is to redress the discriminatory impact
of tax laws on members of disadvantaged groups, there can be no pretext for
confining the inquiry to section 18(1) of the Act or the remedy to business
women.  Insofar as tax deductions are concerned, the real issue would be the
inadequacy of the partial deduction under section 63 in facilitating
self-employed and salaried women's access to the paid workforce.... 
Their identity as self-employed or salaried women is largely immaterial to the
question of whether the existing system perpetuates their subordination.                     I am not unaware of
the issues discussed by Professor Macklin.   I certainly agree that all
women suffer severe social and financial costs associated with
child-bearing and rearing and that these costs are incurred whether a woman is
a self-employed small business owner, a lawyer, an employee or a fulltime
homemaker and caregiver.   In fact, it is my view that all women, as a
consequence of gender, suffer disadvantages associated with caring for
children.                     Further, I am not
unaware that income tax deductions are undoubtedly not the best way for
government to provide assistance with regard to the high cost of child care and
that the allowed deductions under s. 63 are not representative of the real cost
of child care.  Perhaps child care should not even be subsidized through the
tax system but, rather, provided for in another manner.  As is obvious, income
tax deductions benefit only those who have a taxable income and, as such, are a
form of upside down subsidy which allows a person with more income to spend
more on child care and, consequently, to receive a greater portion of the
government tax expenditure program in return and the deduction does not help
families who cannot afford child care in the first place.  Finally, this type
of government subsidy provides no assistance to the development of badly needed
child care facilities.                     Neither am I
ignorant of the fact that the disparate treatment of employed persons and
businesspersons under the Act is problematic and may require future
examination.  (See Ontario Public Service Employees Union v. National
Citizens' Coalition Inc. (1987), 60 O.R. (2d) 26 (H.C.), aff'd (1990), 74
O.R. (2d) 260 (C.A.), where the Ontario Court of Appeal held that the
deductions enjoyed by self-employed persons as opposed to employed persons did
not constitute a violation of s. 15 .)  As I stated earlier, the Act
treats different groups of people differently and vertical equity between the
employed and the self-employed has never been maintained.  There has been no
concern about this dichotomy, however, with regard to other business deductions
allowed under ss. 9 and  18 of the Act and, in my view, the differential
treatment of business taxpayers and other taxpayers is not raised in this
case.  If these many and complex issues were before the Court, a critical
examination of the interplay of socio-economic class in the income tax system,
the position of all women in society and the implications of child care would
have to be examined.   However, these are not the issues before the Court.  Ms.
Symes has not put in issue the enormously complex quandary of the
disadvantagement of women generally through the continuing social and economic
cost of child care.  She has raised the much narrower question, although not in
any way insignificant, of the discrimination suffered by businesspersons --
primarily women -- under an interpretation of the Act that disallows
child care expenses as a business expense incurred for the purpose of gaining
or producing income from her business.   That issue, specifically the
distinction between business taxpayers, must be answered.                     Ms. Symes' claim
cannot be addressed simply by pointing to the greater issue of the position of
women generally.  To grant her a deduction to which she is clearly entitled
under the Act in no way diminishes the larger issue of child care as it
applies to all parents, particularly women, a matter to be left for another
day.  I agree with the intervener the Charter  Committee on Poverty Issues that
the appellant does not challenge s. 63 on the basis of either its inadequacy or
its inclusiveness; Ms. Symes challenges the constitutionality of s. 63 only to
the extent that it affects the court's interpretation and application of other
provisions of the Act governing business deductions.                     My colleague refers
to family status as a possible alternative approach, as well as to the fact
that single mothers may provide a clearer example of hardship suffered as a
consequence of child care than does Ms. Symes.  This may well be true, but this
is no reason why the appellant's rights, under the Act or under s. 15  of
the Charter , should not be protected.  Discrimination cannot be
justified by pointing to other discrimination.  This is not the standard to
which Mr. Andrews was held in Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia,
supra.  In Andrews, the Court did not look at the respondent and
justify the infringement of his rights under s. 15  on the basis that,  in all
other aspects of his life, as a white male lawyer of British descent, such
discrimination on the basis of citizenship was acceptable, since he was likely
better off than most other persons in the disadvantaged group of non-Canadian
citizens.  Neither can this be the standard to which Ms. Symes is to be held. 
This is not a case about the advantageous position in society some women garner
as opposed to other women, but, rather, an examination of the advantaged
position that businessmen hold in relation to businesswomen.  If
each claim under s. 15  of the Charter  required that all the problems of
discrimination with respect to a particular group be remedied as a result of
one investigation, Andrews would probably not yet have been decided. 
The fact that Ms. Symes may be a member of a more privileged economic class
does not by itself invalidate her claim under s. 15  of the Charter .  She
is not to be held responsible for all possible discriminations in the income
tax system, nor for the fact that other women may suffer disadvantages in the
marketplace arising from child care.  As the appellant argues, we cannot
"hold every woman to the position of the most disadvantaged women,
apparently in the name of sex equality".                     I believe that it
is important to recall the context in which the determination of Charter  issues
must be considered, as was set out by my colleague in reference to Wilson J.'s
statements in R. v. Turpin, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1296, and as I wrote in R.
v. Seaboyer, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577, at p. 647:  It
is my view that the constitutional questions must be examined in their broader
political, social and historical context in order to attempt any kind of
meaningful constitutional analysis.  In the context of the Charter 
investigation in the case at hand, we must keep foremost in our minds the
unequal cost of child care that women have traditionally borne, the effect of
such cost on the ability of women to participate in business or otherwise be
gainfully employed and, finally, the impact of child care on women's financial
ability and independence.  In my view, such a "contextual" approach
is an attempt to attack the problem of privilege and to understand the
diversity of people's experiences.  When issues are examined in context, it
becomes clear that some so-called "objective truths" may only be the
reality of a select group in society and may, in fact, be completely inadequate
to deal with the reality of other groups.  As the Honourable Bertha Wilson
comments in "Women, the Family, and the Constitutional Protection of
Privacy" (1992), 17 Queen's L.J. 5, at p. 13:  Real
lives, contemporary women's lives, should not only be taken seriously but
should be regarded as primary in interpreting constitutional guarantees which
impact directly or indirectly on women's equality.  Experiences must not be
"shoehorned" to fit within the constitutional guarantees; rather, the
constitutional guarantees must be interpreted in a way that is responsive to
women's reality.                     The divergent
effect of a different contextual approach can be significant to the outcome of
a case such as the appeal at hand.  As Professor Audrey Macklin, supra,
describes, the contrasting contextual approaches to this case taken by the trial
judge and the Court of Appeal played a pivotal role in the outcome (at pp.
508-9):                     The
simplest way to decipher the diverging views of Mr. Justice Cullen and Mr.
Justice Décary on the Charter  issue is to imagine the judges peering at Beth
Symes through different pairs of glasses.  When the trial judge looked at her,
he saw a business woman standing next to a business man.  When the judges of
the Court of Appeal looked at her, they saw a self-employed, professional woman
standing next to a salaried woman.  In the former scenario, Symes was
disadvantaged by her sex contrary to section 15  and deserved to have her
business expenses treated the same as a businessman's.  In the latter, she was
privileged by her class and made a mockery  of section 15  of the Charter  by
attempting to use her status as a business woman to obtain greater benefits
than those available to salaried women.                     The
gist of Mr. Justice Décary's position is that it is absurd to grant Symes
parity with businessmen if, in so doing, she is placed in a superior position
to other women.  To put it another way, it is preferable that all women be
equally disadvantaged relative to men if the alternative is to improve the
situation of the best-off women.                     The proper
interpretive approach to issues of equality must recognize that a real solution
to discrimination cannot be arrived at without incorporating the perspective of
the group suffering discrimination.  In this case, s. 15 of the Charter demands
that the experience of both women and men shape the definition of business
expense.  Whether child care is consistent with the values of equality and is
representative of the reality faced by women is not doubtful in my mind.                    More generally, I
would like to make the following observations.  A.Women
and Child Care                     In the 1984 Report
of the Commission on Equality in Employment, Rosalie Abella (now of the Ontario
Court of Appeal) stated (at p. 177):  By
Canadian law both parents have a duty to care for their children, but by custom
this responsibility has consistently fallen to the mother.  It is the mother,
therefore, who bears any guilt or social disapprobation for joining the
workforce.  And it is the mother who normally bears the psychological and
actual responsibility for making childcare arrangements. [Emphasis added.]  The implementation of s. 15  of the Charter 
in 1985 has not led to an overnight reversal of this phenomenon.  As Dr.
Armstrong testified, research in Canada and abroad has consistently
demonstrated that women remain primarily responsible for child care, and that
this is so whether women work inside or outside the home.  Dr. Armstrong, asked
to give a synopsis of those studies, said that  they
all produce very consistent results, I think, that while men do some child care
work, that it is consistently across Canada, whether it is Vancouver, Halifax,
Toronto, or Flin Flon, it's clear that the primary responsibility and the major
work load is women's work load; that the kind of child care that men tend to
provide tends to be the discretionary sort -- that you take the children for a
walk or read them a bedtime story or something similar rather than the
necessary tasks that are associated with children, and this research is
consistent whether we're talking about a household in which the woman is
employed full time or whether she's full time at home working there.  In fact, Statistics Canada reports
that working men are chiefly responsible for child care in only 6 percent of
families (Susan Crompton, "Who's Looking After the Kids? Child Care
Arrangements of Working Mothers", in Statistics Canada, Perspectives on
Labour and Income, vol. 3, No. 2 (Summer 1991), at p. 68).                     Further, the
responsibility for child care has also a very real impact on women's patterns
of employment.  According to the Statistics Canada Family History Survey,
ongoing child care had a major impact on the continuity of work for the
majority of women but almost no impact on men.  This is consistent with
research done on women in managerial and professional work which identifies
having children as a major disruption in career patterns and as a problem for
women. (See also M. Gunderson, L. Muszynski and J. Keck, Women and Labour
Market Poverty (1990), at p. 30.)  Dr. Armstrong was not aware of any
similar research on men which identifies raising children as having an impact
on men's careers. As well, as I discussed above, the study recently completed
by the Canadian Bar Association indicates that male lawyers did not
consistently report that child care had any impact on their career  (Touchstones
for Change, supra), whereas female lawyers indicated that they
suffered financial losses as a result of child care responsibilities.  In fact,
Dr. Armstrong observed that the cost alone can consume a large portion of a
woman's income.  Self-employed women do not differ significantly from women as
a whole with respect to the effect of child care.  B.Self-employed
Women                       In 1991, the
Canadian Advisory Council of the Status of Women studied the lives and business
experiences of more than 200 women business owners across Canada. The results
of the Advisory Council's study were published in a document entitled The
Glass Box: Women Business Owners in Canada.  The authors of The Glass
Box found that women's businesses are clustered in the retail and service
sectors, notorious for their long hours, high personal demands, and low
financial returns.  As in the work force generally, where women are clustered
in jobs such as office work and nursing, the effect of ghettoizing is to lower
the financial return to the business owner.                     The authors of the
report describe the typical female surveyed in the following way (at p. 10):                     The
typical respondent could be described as a white woman, married, with two
children, and owning 100% of a retail business.  She is a high school graduate
who worked in a related field before starting her business but had no
experience as a manager.                     Her
current venture is her only one, which she founded six to ten years ago with
less than $25,000 in start-up capital, financed by her own savings.  She
continues to finance the operation herself, taking less than $30,000 annually
in salary, even though she works 50 to 70 hours a week.  The business employs
an average of three people.  The strongest impression remaining after talking
with hundreds of entrepreneurs is the modest nature of the business.  For the
most part, these businesses are not innovative, substantial ventures.                     The annual incomes
reported by the women in the Glass Box survey serve to debunk much of
the myth of the wealthy businesswoman.  One-third of the sample reported
receiving no salary.  Twenty percent made between $30,000 and $50,000, and only
15 percent made over $50,000.  Male business owners reported annual earnings
some 66 percent higher than earnings reported by women business owners.                     Discrimination was
reported by slightly more than half the entrepreneurs in the Glass Box study. 
Creditors, in particular, seem to be using irrelevant criteria such as marital
status and age (linked to childbearing potential) to assess loan applications. 
The authors reported that being married and having children contributes to the
perception of stability in male applicants, but these same factors are taken to
suggest unreliability in women applicants.  More subtle forms of differential
treatment occur when women discover they are invisible to customers, suppliers,
and creditors, many of whom assume that any man present in the business is the
boss.  On page 65  of their report, the authors of The Glass Box stated:  As
we interviewed women entrepreneurs in industrial malls and crowded retail
centres, the image of a woman alone in a glass box emerged.  Isolated by her
unusual occupation as an entrepreneur, by her sole ownership of the business,
by her immigrant status, by her limited networks of colleagues and business
friends, and particularly by the long hours required by business and household
demands, the woman entrepreneur is surrounded by opportunities to which she
cannot gain access.  Thus, in addition to the difficulties facing all
entrepreneurs in starting and making a success of a new business venture, a
woman entrepreneur faces conditions that appear to be attributable almost
completely to the fact that she is a woman in a non-traditional occupation. 
These factors co-exist with the challenges, personal satisfaction, and
independence experienced by women entrepreneurs.  This is the situation we have
described as the glass box of female entrepreneurship.  Surrounded by
opportunities but hemmed in by circumstances, the woman entrepreneur sees her
ability to realize business and personal success limited by a number of
obstacles.                     Nearly half of the
respondents in the Glass Box study were married with children at home. 
Unlike men entrepreneurs, most women assumed complete responsibility for home
and children.  Only 10 percent hired household help, a reflection of either a
lack of financial resources or reluctance to delegate any part of an important
role.  The authors of the Glass Box report found that child care
responsibilities formed one of the major obstacles preventing businesswomen
from realizing their full potential as entrepreneurs.  It is with regard to
this context: the reality of women's lives and the severe implications of child
care, that the present Charter  analysis must be approached.  VII.Conclusion                     My incursion into
s. 15  of the Charter  was mandated only by my colleague's comments in
that connection.  In my view, Ms. Symes must succeed primarily on statutory
interpretation of the Act and, in particular, ss. 9 and 18 of the Act. 
Moreover, if s. 63 is to inform these sections, they do clearly co-exist. 
Child care may be deductible as a business expense in those cases where the
requirements for deductibility of business expenses are met.  With regard to s.
15  of the Charter , it is my opinion that the values of equality it
implies shape the determination of the issues in the interpretation of s. 63 of
the Act.  An interpretation that runs contrary to these values must be
rejected.                     In the result, I
would allow the appeal, reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restore
the judgment of the trial judge, the whole with costs throughout.                     The following are
the reasons delivered by                     McLachlin
J. (dissenting) -- I
agree with Justice L'Heureux-Dubé's interpretation of ss. 9, 18 and 63 of the Income
Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, and s. 15  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms , and with her conclusion that the appellant's child
care expenses are deductible as business expenses under s. 9 of the Income
Tax Act.                      Solicitors for the
