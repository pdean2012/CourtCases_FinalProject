248(1) .  The appellant Society applied to the Minister of
National Revenue for registration as a charitable organization under
ss. 149.1(1)  and 248(1)  of the Income Tax Act .  The Society’s
purposes, as stated in its amended constitution, were  “(a) to provide
educational forums, classes, workshops and seminars to immigrant women in order
that they may be able to find or obtain employment or self employment; (b) to
carry on political activities provided such activities are incidental and
ancillary to the above purposes and provided such activities do not include
direct or indirect support of, or opposition to, any political party or
candidate for public office; (c) to raise funds in order to carry out the above
purposes by means of solicitations of funds from governments, corporations and
individuals; and (e) to provide services and to do all such things that are
incidental or conducive to the attainment of the above stated objects,
including the seeking of funds from governments and/or other sources for the
implementation of the aforementioned objectives.”  The Society described its
activities as providing a “public benefit” through services and workshops
designed to “advance education”. The Society’s activities included a “career
and vocational counselling service” to assist women in obtaining employment,
and assistance in such practical skills as résumé writing and interview skills
as well as activities such as networking, soliciting job opportunities,
maintaining a job skills directory, liaising for accreditation of foreign
credentials and offering referral services.  Revenue Canada rejected the
Society’s application mainly because it was not convinced that the organization
was constituted exclusively for charitable purposes, as required for
registration under the Act.  The Federal Court of Appeal dismissed the
Society’s appeal.  Held (L’Heureux-Dubé,
Gonthier and McLachlin JJ. dissenting):  The appeal should be dismissed.  Per Cory, Iacobucci,
Major and Bastarache JJ.: For an organization to qualify for registration under
s. 248(1)  of the Income Tax Act :  (1) the purposes of the
organization must be charitable, and must define the scope of the activities
engaged in by the organization; and (2) all of the organization’s resources
must be devoted to these activities unless the organization falls within the
specific exemptions of s. 149.1(6.1)  or (6.2) .  Since the Act does not
define “charitable”, Canadian courts have consistently applied the Pemsel
test to determine that question.  The Pemsel classification is generally
understood to refer to the preamble of the Statute of Elizabeth, which
gave examples of charitable purposes.  While the courts have always had the
jurisdiction to decide what is charitable and were never bound by the preamble,
the law of charities has proceeded by way of analogy to the purposes enumerated
in the preamble. The Pemsel classification is subject to the
consideration that the purpose must also be “for the benefit of the community
or of an appreciably important class of the community” rather than for private
advantage.  While the definition of “charitable organization” in
s. 149.1(1)  focuses on “charitable activities” rather than purposes, it is
really the purpose in furtherance of which an activity is carried out, not the
character of the activity itself, that determines whether or not the activity
is of a charitable nature.  Accordingly, in making that determination, the
inquiry must focus not only on the activities of an organization but also on
its purposes. Subject to the exemptions provided by s. 149.1(6.1) and (6.2) ,
s. 149.1(1)  requires that all of the purposes and activities of the
organization be charitable.  However, even the pursuit of a purpose which would
be non-charitable in itself may not disqualify an organization from being
considered charitable if it is pursued only as a means of fulfilment of
another, charitable purpose and not as an end in itself.  Under the traditional approach, the “advancement of
education” head of the Pemsel classification is generally limited in
Canada to the “formal training of the mind” or the “improvement of a useful
branch of human knowledge”.  While purpose (a) -- the primary purpose of the
Society -- would not qualify as charitable under the traditional approach as it
seems to lack the element of systematic instruction, there is no logical or
principled reason why a more expansive definition of education for the purposes
of the law of charity should not be adopted.  To limit the notion of “training
of the mind” to structured, systematic instruction or traditional academic
subjects reflects an outmoded and underinclusive understanding of education
which is of little use in modern Canadian society.  So long as information or
training is provided in a structured manner and for a genuinely educational
purpose -- that is, to advance the knowledge or abilities of the recipients --
and not solely to promote a particular point of view or political orientation,
it may properly be viewed as falling within the advancement of education.
Education should not be broadened beyond recognition but the law ought to
accommodate any legitimate form of education. Here, purpose (a) is charitable
under the proposed more expansive definition of education.  The purpose is to
train the minds of immigrant women in certain important life skills, with a
specific end in mind:  equipping them to find and secure employment in Canada. 
Moreover, certain activities carried out in furtherance of this purpose, such
as the provision of the educational programs contemplated by the purposes
clause, are undoubtedly charitable within this expanded definition, whether or
not they have the quality of systematic instruction traditionally associated
with education in the charitable sense. The purpose also satisfies the
requirement that it benefit “the community or . . . an appreciably important
class of the community”.  To bring a purpose within the fourth head of Pemsel,
more is required than simple “public benefit”, in the ordinary sense of the
term.  It is incumbent upon the Society to explain just how its purposes are
beneficial in a way the law regards as charitable.  To assess whether an
organization’s purposes are charitable under that head, a court should:  (1)
consider the trend of those decisions which have established certain objects as
charitable under this heading, and ask whether, by reasonable extension or
analogy, the instant case may be considered to be in line with these; (2)
examine certain accepted anomalies to see whether they fairly cover the objects
under consideration; and (3) ask whether, consistently with the objects
declared, the income and property in question can be applied for purposes
clearly falling outside the scope of charity; if so, the argument for charity
must fail.  To this approach must be added the general requirement that the purpose
also be “for the benefit of the community or of an appreciably important class
of the community”.  This approach indicates that the Society’s purpose (a) is
not charitable under the fourth head.   No “trend” can be discerned from
previous decisions recognizing that assisting immigrant women to integrate into
society through helping them to obtain employment is a charitable purpose under
the fourth head of charity.  Purpose (a) should therefore be characterized
solely in terms of education.  A valid charitable organization must be constituted
exclusively for charitable purposes.  While political purposes are not
generally considered charitable, the  Society’s purposes clause makes clear
that the sole purpose of carrying out political activities and raising funds
under clause 2(b) and (c) is to facilitate a valid educational purpose. 
Accordingly,  purposes (b) and (c) can be taken as means to the fulfilment of
purpose (a), not ends in themselves, and thus do not disqualify the Society
from obtaining registration as a charity under the Act.  It is difficult, 
however, to discern whether purpose (e) is a means of fulfilment or an end in
itself because of its extremely broad wording, which mandates the Society to do
“all such things that are incidental or conducive to the attainment of” its
other purposes.  One purpose may be conducive to another while still remaining
an end in itself, not merely a means to the fulfilment of the second purpose. 
This, combined with the exceedingly vague content of purpose (e), leads to the
conclusion that it cannot be classified as charitable simply on the basis of
its relationship to the educational purpose disclosed in purpose (a). 
Furthermore, the question of whether an organization was constituted
exclusively for charitable purposes cannot be determined solely by reference to
the objects and purposes for which it was originally established.  It is also
necessary to consider the nature of the activities presently carried on by the
organization as a potential indicator of whether it has since adopted other
purposes.  Here, the nature of the activities carried out by the Society
further supports the conclusion as to the non-charitable character of purpose
(e).  The provision of a job skills directory and the establishment of support
groups for professionals do not constitute educational activities, nor do they
appear to be “incidental” to the attainment of purpose (a) of the Society. 
They must fall under purpose (e) as activities “conducive” to the other
purposes.  However, while these may well be useful services, they are directly
in furtherance of helping immigrant women to find employment, which in itself
is not a charitable purpose.  The purposes of the Society therefore can and do
accommodate non-charitable activities.  They are simply too vague and
indeterminate to permit the Society to qualify for charitable status under the
fourth head of Pemsel.  In the result, the Society has not satisfied
either of the two criteria for registration as a charity under s. 248(1)
of the Act.  While some of the Society’s purposes contemplate charitable
activities, they do not  restrict the Society to charitable activities alone.  Even though some substantial change in the law of
charity would be desirable and welcome at this time, it would not be
appropriate for the Court, in the context of this case, to adopt an entirely
new definition of charity.  If this is to be done, especially for the purposes
of the Income Tax Act , the specifics of the desired approach will be for
Parliament to decide since a new and more expansive definition of charity,
without warning, could have a substantial and serious effect on the taxation
system.  The operation of the charitable registration scheme in
the Income Tax Act  does not violate the equality rights of the Society’s
intended beneficiaries under s. 15  of the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms .  The interplay of Pemsel and the Income Tax Act 
results in a scheme whereby any organization, by restricting itself to
charitable purposes and activities, can qualify for registration as a
charitable organization.  This requirement applies uniformly to every
organization that seeks to be registered as charitable.  Per L’Heureux-Dubé,
Gonthier and McLachlin JJ. (dissenting): The starting point for the courts in
determining whether a particular purpose is charitable is the Pemsel
case, which provides a classification of charitable purposes. The Pemsel
classification carves out three presumptively charitable categories (relief of
poverty, advancement of education, and advancement of religion) and creates a
residual fourth category of charitable purposes (“other purposes beneficial to
the community”), which itself comprises a number of recognized subcategories. 
Any purpose which is charitable must fit into one or more of the four Pemsel
categories.  Further, a valid charitable organization must be constituted
exclusively for charitable purposes.  This requirement is reflected in the
definition of “charitable organization” in s. 149.1(1) of the Act,  which
also requires  that a charitable organization must devote all of its resources
to charitable activities.  The pursuit of purposes which, though not charitable
in themselves, are merely ancillary or incidental to the fulfilment of the
primary, charitable, purposes of an organization will not cause the
organization to run afoul of the exclusivity requirement.  Furthermore,  for
the organization to qualify as charitable,  its purposes must be “for the
benefit of the community or of an appreciably important class of the
community”.  The public benefit requirement has two distinct components:  there
must be an objectively measurable and socially useful benefit conferred; and it
must be a benefit available to a sufficiently large section of the population
to be considered a public benefit.  Although the public benefit requirement
applies to all charitable purposes, it is of particular concern under the fourth
head of the Pemsel classification.  This is so because under the first
three heads, public benefit is essentially a rebuttable presumption, whereas
under the fourth head it must be demonstrated.  In determining whether a particular purpose may be
placed within one or more of the Pemsel categories, the courts adhere to
the analogical approach to legal reasoning familiar to the common law.  Since
the Pemsel classification does not itself provide any enumeration of
purposes from which to analogize to putatively charitable purposes under
consideration, the courts should consider whether the purpose is analogous to
one of the purposes enumerated in the preamble of the Statute of Elizabeth 
or build analogy upon analogy. While the courts should not shy away from the
recognition of new purposes which respond to pressing social needs, the pursuit
of analogy should not lead the courts astray. To modernize the existing
categories of charitable purposes, a court should adhere to the principles of altruism
and public benefit  in order to identify new charitable purposes and to ensure
that existing ones continue to serve the public good.  When considering a
purpose under the fourth head of the Pemsel classification, the mere
fact that a purpose is of public benefit does not, without more, render that
purpose charitable.  To qualify as charitable, a purpose must be beneficial to
the public “in a way which the law regards as charitable”. The best approach
for making such a determination is one which marries adherence to principle
with respect for the existing categories as established by the Pemsel
scheme.  In the law of charity, the courts’ primary concern is
to determine whether the purposes being pursued are charitable.  It is these
purposes which are essential, not the activities engaged in, although the
activities must bear a coherent relationship to the purposes sought to be
achieved. Accordingly, in determining whether an organization should be
registered as a charitable organization, the proper approach is to begin by: 
(a) identifying the primary purposes of the organization; and then (b)
determining whether those purposes are charitable.  If one concludes that the
purposes are not charitable, then the organization is not charitable, and the
inquiry ends there.  However, if the organization’s primary purposes are
charitable, then it must be considered (c) whether the other purposes pursued
by the organization are ancillary or incidental to its primary purposes; and
(d) whether the activities engaged in by the organization are sufficiently
related to its purposes to be considered to be furthering them.  If positive
responses are made to these two latter inquiries, then the organization should
be registered as a charitable organization.  The Society’s purpose is set out
in clause 2(a) of its constitution and the other purposes are merely
subsidiary to, and in direct furtherance of, this purpose.  The “advancement of education” head of the Pemsel
classification has traditionally been given a relatively restrictive
interpretation in Canada and this  traditional definition should be abandoned
in favour of a more modern conception.   So long as information or training is
provided in a structured manner and for a genuinely educational purpose -- that
is, to advance the knowledge or abilities of the recipients -- and not solely
to promote a particular point of view or political orientation, it may properly
be viewed as falling within the advancement of education.  In order to be
educational under this head, an organization must pursue “actual teaching” or a
“learning component”. The concept of education, however, is not amenable to
indefinite expansion.  The more that purposes stray from traditional
conceptions of education, the more difficult it will be to engage in the task
of distinguishing charitable from non-charitable purposes.   Here,  the
“advancement of education” head encompasses the Society’s purpose  set out in
clause 2(a) of its constitution.   Accordingly, the Society is prima facie
charitable because its purpose is charitable under a head of the Pemsel
classification.  The Society’s purpose can also be placed within the
fourth head of the Pemsel classification.  Assisting the settlement of
immigrants and refugees, and their integration into national life, is a
charitable purpose already recognized under the fourth head and the Society’s
purpose is subsumed within this subcategory.  Immigrants are often in special
need of assistance in their efforts to integrate into their new home.  The
Society provides assistance, guidance, and learning opportunities.  It helps
immigrants in developing and acquiring vocational skills, so that they may
obtain employment.  An organization, such as the Society, which assists
immigrants through this difficult transition is directed towards a charitable
purpose.  Clearly, a direct benefit redounds to the individuals receiving
assistance from the Society, and the nation as a whole gains from the
integration of those individuals into its fabric.  That is the public benefit
at issue here.   Under the fourth head of the Pemsel
classification, to qualify as charitable the class of persons eligible to
benefit must be the community as a whole, or an appreciably important class of
the community.  The Society has not impermissibly limited the scope of its
class of beneficiaries.  Despite its primary focus on immigrant women, there is
no indication that in practice the Society’s beneficiaries are exclusively
women or members of minority groups.  On the contrary, the evidence suggests
that the Society’s services are open to all in need of them.  The political purposes doctrine has no application on
the facts of this appeal.  It is obvious from a plain reading of clause 2(b)
that the Society’s purpose is not political.  Clause 2(b) does not
authorize the Society to pursue political purposes, but merely enables it to
engage in political activities in furtherance of its charitable purpose,
provided that such political activities are incidental and ancillary to that
charitable purpose.  The Society’s purpose is not too vague or uncertain to
be charitable.  The purposes of an organization will almost invariably be
phrased in broad, general terms and that cannot, of itself, render those words
ambiguous.  One should not aspire to an unrealistic degree of precision in such
matters.  By inserting the words “or conducive” into clause 2(e), the
Society did not place itself outside the scope of legal charity.  Though
notionally a purpose clause, what is contemplated by clause 2(e) is the
ability to conduct activities, not purposes.  The key observation is that an
organization whose purpose is charitable does not surrender that status merely
because it engages in some activities which are not in themselves charitable,
so long as those activities are subordinate to, and in furtherance of, the
exclusively charitable purpose of the organization.  That is the case here. 
The plain language of clause 2(e) indicates the obvious intent of the drafter
to enable the Society to carry out certain activities in furtherance of its
purpose.  It is unnecessary in this case to engage in a
wholesale revision of the common law definition of charity because the
Society’s purpose can be placed within the existing Pemsel categories. 
Before asking this Court to modify the common law, litigants should demonstrate
that they have exhausted the possibilities of the existing law.  In the law of
charity, those possibilities are considerable.  Cases Cited  By Iacobucci J.   By Gonthier J. (dissenting)  D’Aguiar v. Guyana Commissioner of Inland Revenue, [1970] T.R. 31; Native Communications Society of B.C. v. Canada

I have had the benefit of reading the reasons of my colleague
Iacobucci J.  Although there is considerable agreement between
Iacobucci J.’s reasoning and my own as to the appropriate scope to be given
to the legal categories of charity, I find myself unable to agree with certain
aspects of my colleague’s reasons.  More importantly, I disagree with my
colleague as to the manner in which the legal definition of charity should be
applied to the particular circumstances of this appeal, and hence, with the
result he reaches.  Accordingly, I have felt it necessary to set out my own
reasons.  I. Facts  3                                  
The appellant Society, which is based in Vancouver, was incorporated on
December 19, 1985, under the Society Act, R.S.B.C.
1979, c. 390 (now R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 433), as a corporation without
share capital.  In 1992, the Society made its first application to Revenue
Canada seeking registration as a registered charity under ss. 149.1(1)  and
248(1)  of the Income Tax Act  (“ITA ”).  Revenue Canada, in a
letter to the Society dated April 10, 1992, refused to register the
Society as a registered charity, and gave reasons for its decision.  So began a
lengthy series of correspondence between the Society, its counsel, and Revenue
Canada.  Although Revenue Canada’s initial refusal decision is not the subject
of the present appeal, Revenue Canada’s ultimate refusal to register the
Society must be interpreted in the light of this long chain of correspondence. 
Because the correspondence and the constituting documents of the Society make
up the entire record in this appeal, I outline them in some detail in the
following paragraphs.  4                                  
In response to Revenue Canada’s first refusal decision, the Society
amended its constitution on August 21, 1992, to restrict the scope of
its purposes, so that the Society’s purposes were as set out below:  2.    (a)       To educate members of the Community
at large, including immigrant & visible minority women, on the needs and
concerns of immigrant & visible minority women in Canada;  (b)       To foster and promote social awareness
and community  involvement in civic education, volunteer and membership
development and preventive social services;  (c)       To facilitate immigrant and visible
minority women in achieving economic and social independence and their full
potential in Canadian society;  (d)       To co-operate and build a network within
British Columbia, especially among immigrant and visible minority women and
concerned individuals and groups, in order to provide current information and
services for the purpose of mutual support;  (e)       To provide services and to do all such
things that are incidental or conducive to the attainment of the above stated
objects, including the seeking of funds from governments and/or other sources
for the implementation of the aforementioned objectives.  5                                  
On March 17, 1993, the Society replied to Revenue Canada’s
refusal letter.  The Society explained why it should be registered under the ITA ,
and asked that its application be re-assessed.  The Society’s letter outlined
its purposes and activities.  It reiterated its earlier assertion that its
purposes were “non-political”.  The Society stated that it sought to assist and
educate the community at large, but that its particular (though non-exclusive)
focus was upon immigrant and visible minority women.  The Society indicated
that its services and workshops were designed to “relieve poverty” and “advance
education”.  To these ends, the Society’s activities included a “career and
vocational counselling service” to assist women in obtaining employment, and
assistance in such practical skills as “resume writing, interview skills, and
dealing with Canadian employers”.  In addition, the Society indicated that one
of its current projects was an “anti-racism education workshop”.  6                                  
Revenue Canada replied with a form letter on April 5, 1993
indicating that it would not commence a review of the Society’s application
until it had received further information from the Society.  Revenue Canada’s
letter stated that the Society’s March 17, 1993 application had not
been made on the prescribed form, and enclosed a copy of the T2050 form.  7                                  
The Society made a second application for registration on
May 10, 1993, by completing the T2050 form and returning it to
Revenue Canada, along with a cover letter.  A Revenue Canada official
telephoned the Society on August 24, 1993, to request further
clarification as to how its programs were conducted and who was eligible to
participate in the programs.  The Revenue Canada official wrote a memorandum to
file regarding the information obtained during this telephone conversation. 
The relevant portion of the memorandum is set out below:  1.  Membership  About 300 members from all walks of life seeking
employment opportunities and general support for integration into Canadian
life.  2.  Job Skills Directory  In addition to its own membership, others wishing
to be included in the directory are listed, for a total of approx. 600 persons,
ranging from those on social assistance to professionals who have been in the
country for a few years and wish to re-enter the work force.  No percentages
available re income level of those listed.  The Society does not arrange interviews for persons
listed.  Organizations wishing to employ persons send notice to the Society of
jobs that are available.  While this information may be brought to the
attention of individuals with the required skills, it is up to the person to
make the contact and seek the job.  The Directory is not circulated in the job market,
but its existence is advertised by the Society in EIC, in educational
institutions, etc.  3.  Job Skills Training  Other than placing volunteer workers as
receptionists, clerks, bookkeepers, computer operators, etc. within the
Society’s operation, no training in various skills is undertaken by the
Society.  However, pre-Employment counselling re resumes,
conduct of job interviews, where to apply for jobs, etc. is conducted by the
Society.  4.  Employment Equity and Foreign Credentials Committees  Both are concerned with the matter of recognition
of degrees and certifications earned in other countries which are not accepted
in Canada.  Workshops and meetings with teaching and nursing associations and
institutions are held to discuss accreditation of certifications and informing
individuals of courses required to bring their qualifications to Canadian
standards.  This is strictly an educational process -- doesn’t
involve legislation.  5.  ESL Classes -- are conducted by Employment & Immigration
Canada.  The Society refers its people to EIC and advises EIC when a need for
the class arises.  6.  Support Group for Professionals  Assistance and encouragement is given by
professional committee to professional members wishing to enter or re-enter the
work force, most often with regard to upgrading their certification to meet
Canadian requirements.                                                                     .
. .  I questioned “preventive social services”.  She explained such
activities as public workshop [sic], meetings on matters like abuse,
violence vs. women, anti-racism.  8                                  
On August 27, 1993, Revenue Canada wrote to the Society to
advise it that, as it was then constituted, the Society was “unlikely to
qualify for registration”.  The letter outlined Revenue Canada’s various
objections to the Society’s purposes and activities.  On December 3, 1993,
counsel for the Society wrote to Revenue Canada, enclosing a draft copy of
further proposed amendments to the Society’s constitution for Revenue Canada’s
review and approval.  The proposed amendments had been drafted in response to
Revenue Canada’s earlier objections, and revised the Society’s purposes to read
as follows:  2.  PURPOSES  The purposes of the Society are:  a.    to provide educational forums, classes,
workshops and seminars to immigrant women in order that they may be able to
find or obtain employment or self employment;  b.    to carry on political activities provided
such activities are incidental and ancillary to the above purposes and provided
such activities do not include direct or indirect support of, or opposition to,
any political party or candidate for public office; and  c.    to raise funds in order to carry out the
above purposes by means of solicitations of funds from governments,
corporations and individuals.  9                                  
A Revenue Canada official telephoned counsel for the Society on
December 23, 1993, to explain her continuing concerns about the
wording of the Society’s proposed objects.  In a memorandum to file, the
Revenue Canada official indicated that she had also explained to counsel for
the Society that she had concerns about the Society’s activities.  The
memorandum stated that the Society was told that “the educational aspect must
be conducted in a structured manner, not merely informational [sic]”,
and that “immigrant and visible minority women as a whole was [sic] not
an object of charity”.  Finally, the memorandum indicated that the Society was
told that its proposed objects were “not acceptable”, particularly the
reference to political activities in clause 2(b), and that counsel for the
Society had indicated that object 2(a) “did not really reflect what the
organization is doing”.  10                              
This telephone call was followed by a letter from Revenue Canada to the
Society dated January 25, 1994, which again outlined Revenue Canada’s
objections to the Society’s proposed objects.  In that letter, Revenue Canada
stated that proposed purpose 2(a) could be a charitable purpose, but only
if the Society’s intent was to “educate persons in the charitable sense of
training the mind which includes the learning of a vocational skill, or to
improve on a useful branch of human knowledge”.  However, the mere presentation
of “selected items of information” would not qualify as being for the
advancement of education.  Revenue Canada also stated that proposed
purposes 2(b) and (c) were not charitable purposes, but that they might be
considered “as ancillary and incidental activities carried on in furtherance of
a charitable purpose”.  The letter went on to state:  Turning to activities undertaken by the Society which might have been
considered educational, it appears from our further examination of the material
on file that these are primarily information sessions.  I cite, for example,
discussions sponsored by the Society on such subjects as human rights,
employment equity, violence and abuse against women, and how to start a small
business.  While these sessions are indeed informative and helpful to
interested persons, they do not appear to be presented in a systematic and
structured manner considered to be educational in the charitable sense. 
Additionally, activities such as networking, liaising for accreditation of
credentials and the compilation and circulation of a Job Skills Directory are
neither educational nor charitable activities and are more apt to provide a
private rather than public benefit.  In determining whether an applicant qualifies for charitable registration,
I must emphasize that we take into account the organization’s operation and
application of its resources as a whole.  While all activities undertaken by
the Society have not been addressed in this letter, the salient points
regarding the advancement of education have been explained.  11                              
The Society responded with a letter dated May 4, 1994,
confirming that it “does not engage in any partisan political activity”, and
that, as required by the ITA , it does not spend more than 10 percent
of its budget on political activity.  The letter did not address the other
concerns outlined by Revenue Canada’s letter of January 25, 1994. 
Perhaps surprisingly, given Revenue Canada’s unfavourable response, the Society
amended its constitution on May 10, 1994, in line with its earlier
proposal.  Paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) were replaced by the three paragraphs
set out in the Society’s letter of December 3, 1993.  Paragraph (d)
was deleted.  The Society’s purposes thus read as follows:  2.    a.  to provide educational forums, classes,
workshops and seminars to immigrant women in order that they may be able to
find or obtain employment or self employment;  b.  to carry on political activities provided such
activities are incidental and ancillary to the above purposes and provided such
activities do not include direct or indirect support of, or opposition to, any
political party or candidate for public office; and  c.  to raise funds in order to carry out the above
purposes by means of solicitations of funds from governments, corporations and
individuals;  d.  e.  to provide services and to do all such things
that are incidental or conducive to the attainment of the above stated objects,
including the seeking of funds from governments and/or other sources for the
implementation of the aforementioned objectives.  12                              
Counsel for the Society sent another letter to Revenue Canada, dated
May 20, 1994, in which it again sought status as a registered
charity, and took issue with Revenue Canada’s previous assertion that the
Society’s objects were not charitable.  Included with this letter was a copy of
a report written in 1989 by Lakshmi Bhagavatula entitled “A Study of Immigrant
Women in Vancouver”.  A Revenue Canada official indicated, in response to a
telephone inquiry from the Society, that Revenue Canada would refuse the
Society’s application for registration, and that a formal written refusal would
be sent to the Society in due course.  In a letter dated
October 14, 1994, Revenue Canada refused to register the Society as a
charitable organization.  13                              
The Society appealed Revenue Canada’s refusal to register it as a
charitable organization to the Federal Court of Appeal, pursuant to
s. 172(3)  of the ITA .  On March 6, 1996, the Federal
Court of Appeal (Décary J.A., Strayer and Linden JJ.A. concurring)
dismissed the Society’s appeal.  The Society was granted leave to appeal to
this Court on March 6, 1997 (L’Heureux-Dubé, Sopinka and
McLachlin JJ.), [1997] 1 S.C.R. xii.  II. Relevant

at Issue  A.  Revenue
Canada’s Refusal Decision, October 14, 1994  15                              
In a letter dated October 14, 1994, Revenue Canada denied the
Society’s application for registration as a charitable organization under
ss. 149.1(1)  and 248(1)  of the ITA .  Revenue Canada emphasized that
in order to be eligible for registration as a charity, an organization’s
purposes must be exclusively charitable, and it must devote substantially all
of its resources towards those charitable purposes.  Revenue Canada stated that
its previous concerns on the point had not been alleviated by the Society’s
letter of May 20, 1994.  16                              
First, Revenue Canada rejected the analogy which the Society had drawn
between its beneficiaries, immigrant and visible minority women, and aboriginal
people.  On this basis, Revenue Canada distinguished Native Communications
Society of B.C. v. Canada (M.N.R.), [1986] 3 F.C. 471 (C.A.), the case
relied upon by the Society in support of its application.  Revenue Canada took
the position that women as a class do not meet the criteria set out in that
case, and stated that “the courts have not considered women simply by virtue of
their gender or racial origin to be in special need of charitable relief”.  17                              
Second, Revenue Canada was not persuaded by the Society’s claim that its
programs fit within the common law definition of “advancement of education” as
that term is understood in the law of charity.  Revenue Canada observed that
the Society’s submission “has not demonstrated that the Society’s programs fall
into the education category or that its method of operation and activities have
been altered to pursue the revised objective”.  18                              
Third, Revenue Canada repeated its concern, expressed in its earlier
letter to the Society of January 25, 1994, that object 2(b) of
the Society “is a political purpose and an organization created for political
purposes, whether in whole or in part, cannot be charitable”.  19                              
Finally, Revenue Canada outlined its most fundamental objection to the
Society’s application for registration:  I would advise that although some of the activities carried on by the
Society may appear to be charitable, the submission has not demonstrated that
the organization devotes substantially all its resources to charitable
activities.  Activities such as networking, referral services, liaising for
accreditation of credentials, soliciting job opportunities and maintaining a
job skills directory as described in the Society’s May 1993 Report are not
charitable activities.  20                              
Accordingly, Revenue Canada denied the Society’s request for
registration as a charitable organization.  B.  Federal Court of Appeal, 96 D.T.C. 6232  21                              
Décary J.A. (with whom Strayer and Linden JJ.A. joined)
dismissed the Society’s appeal from Revenue Canada’s refusal to register it as
a charitable organization.  Décary J.A. held that the primary issue was
whether the Society’s activities fell within one or more of the categories of
charity set out by Lord Macnaghten in Commissioners for Special Purposes of
the Income Tax v. Pemsel, [1891] A.C. 531 (H.L.), as developed by the
Federal Court of Appeal in subsequent cases, including Native Communications
Society, supra, and Everywoman’s Health Centre Society (1988) v.
M.N.R., [1992] 2 F.C. 52.  In particular, the two categories of the Pemsel
scheme under consideration were the second (“advancement of education”) and
fourth (“other purposes beneficial to the community”).  22                              
Décary J.A. found no reversible error in Revenue Canada’s decision
refusing to register the Society as a charitable organization.  Under the head
of “advancement of education”, Décary J.A. held, at p. 6233, that
purpose “(a)” of the Society, as set out in its amended constitution,
namely  a.    to provide educational forums, classes,
workshops and seminars to immigrant women in order that they may be able to
find or obtain employment or self employment;  as well as the
Society’s activities as described in the material before the court “are not
sufficiently structured and articulated as to respond to the requirements set
out by the jurisprudence”.  23                              
Second, Décary J.A. held that the Society’s purposes did not fit
within the fourth category of charity identified by Lord Macnaghten in Pemsel. 
In particular, Décary J.A. rejected the Society’s efforts to analogize its
beneficiaries to aboriginal people, and so bring the Society in line with the
Federal Court of Appeal’s decision in Native Communications Society, supra.  24                              
Third, Décary J.A. declined to accept the Society’s Charter 
arguments, although it is not entirely clear from the Court’s reasons exactly
what those arguments were.  It appears that the Society attempted to place its
class of proposed beneficiaries within s. 15(1)  of the Canadian Charter
of Rights and Freedoms , arguing that an organization whose purpose was to
benefit a class of people identifiable by an enumerated or analogous ground
under s. 15(1)  of the Charter  should be considered to be, prima
facie, charitable in law.  Décary J.A. held that the mere fact that
the Society intended to benefit persons specifically protected by s. 15(1) 
of the Charter  could not in itself render the Society’s purposes (or
activities) charitable.  The provision of a benefit to those in a position to
invoke Charter  rights was not in itself a purpose or activity falling
within the fourth head of Lord Macnaghten’s classification in Pemsel.  25                              
In closing, Décary J.A. stated, at p. 6233, that the Federal
Court of Appeal’s “basic difficulty” with the Society’s application was that
“its purposes and activities are so indefinite and vague as to prevent the
Minister, and this Court, from determining with some degree of certainty what
the activities are, who are the true beneficiaries of the activities and
whether these beneficiaries are persons in need of charity as opposed to merely
being in need of help”.  On this basis, Décary J.A. concluded that the
Minister had not erred in denying the Society’s application for registration as
a charitable organization.  IV. Analysis  A.  Introduction  26                              
Given the central role that charities play in our society, the
large sums of money devoted to charitable purposes, and the considerable
privileges that attach to charitable status, Parliament has considered it
essential to provide a legal framework to regulate charities and their
activities.  That legal framework, which aims to ensure that charities use the
funds provided to them for charitable purposes, and pursue those purposes in an
efficient manner, is of ancient origin.  The constantly evolving common law
definition of charity has been incorporated into federal income tax legislation
since charities were accorded special status under The Income War Tax Act,
1917, S.C. 1917, c. 28, s. 5(d).  The
present appeal requires us to consider the definition of charity, and more
particularly, to determine whether the Society fits within the scope of the
term “charitable organization” in s. 149.1(1)  of the ITA .  For the
reasons that follow, I believe that it does.  27                              
An organization seeking status as a registered charity under the ITA 
must apply to the Minister under s. 248(1)  of the ITA .  The
Minister’s authority under that subsection has been delegated, by the operation
of s. 900(8) of the Income Tax Regulations, C.R.C., c. 945, to
the Director, Charities Division of the Department of National Revenue,
Taxation.  Perhaps surprisingly, the ITA  and its regulations say
practically nothing about the process by which such applications are to be
considered, the requirements for registration, or the materials to be submitted
in support of such applications.  28                              
It is well known that the ITA  does not define “charity” or
“charitable”, other than to define “charity” to mean “a charitable organization
or charitable foundation”, which are themselves defined terms.  Instead,
as the Federal Court of Appeal stated in Positive Action Against Pornography
v. M.N.R., [1988] 2 F.C. 340, at p. 347, “the Act appears clearly to
envisage a resort to the common law for a definition of #charity$
in its legal sense as well as for the principles that should guide us in
applying that definition”.  Because the law of charity had its origin in
the law of trusts, many of the leading authorities in this area arose in the
context of determining the essential validity of a putative charitable trust. 
Since the introduction of the ITA , the tax dimension of charities law
has assumed much greater practical importance.  Most cases now concern a
pre-existing organization (which may take one of a number of possible legal
forms) seeking registration under the ITA , rather than the evaluation of
the essential validity of a trust.  Parliament has, in effect, incorporated the
common law definition of charity into the ITA , and in doing so, has
implicitly accepted that the courts have a continuing role to rationalize and
update that definition to keep it in tune with social and economic
developments.  I note in passing that the definition of “charity” or
“charitable” under the ITA  may not accord precisely with the way those
terms are understood in the common law provinces, due to judicial decisions and
provincial statutory incursions into the common law.  The ITA’s
conception of charity, by contrast, is uniform federal law across the country.  29                              
Two main advantages are obtained by achieving status as a
registered charity.  The first is the ability to provide receipts to donors,
who, if they are individuals, are entitled to claim a tax credit for their
“total charitable gifts” (defined in s. 118.1(1)  of the ITA ),
pursuant to s. 118.1(3)  of the ITA , and if corporations, may claim
a deduction from their taxable income for all “charitable gifts”, pursuant to
s. 110.1(1) (a) of the ITA .  Second,
registered charities pay no tax on income (ITA, s. 149(1) (f)). 
The attraction of status as a registered charity is thus obvious.  B.  Principles Governing the Law of Charity  30                              
As my colleague Iacobucci J. observes, the definition of
“charity” is the product of almost four centuries of common law development.  Given the historical origins of this branch of law, English
jurisprudence has been highly influential.  The starting point for determining
whether a purpose is charitable in law is the Charitable Uses Act, 1601
(also known as the Statute of Elizabeth or the Statute of Charitable
Uses, 43 Eliz. 1, c. 4).  The preamble to that statute contains an
enumeration of various charitable purposes:  WHEREAS Landes Tenements Rentes Annuities Profittes
Hereditamentes, Goodes  Chattels Money and Stockes of Money, have bene
heretofore given limitted appointed and assigned, as well by the Queenes moste
excellent Majestie and her moste noble Progenitors, as by sondrie other well
disposed persons, some for Releife of aged impotent and poore people, some for
Maintenance of sicke and maymed Souldiers and Marriners, Schooles of Learninge,
Free Schooles and Schollers in Universities, some for Repaire of Bridges Portes
Havens Causwaies Churches Seabankes and Highewaies, some for Educacion and
prefermente of Orphans, some for or towardes Releife Stocke or Maintenance for
Howses for Correccion, some for Mariages of poore Maides, some for Supportacion
Ayde and Helpe of younge Tradesmen, Handiecraftesmen and persons decayed, and
others for releife or redemption of Prisoners or Captives, and for aide or ease
of any poore Inhabitants concerninge paymente of Fifteenes, settinge out of
Souldiers and other Taxes, Whiche Landes Tenements Rents Annuities Profitts
Hereditaments Goodes Chattells Money and Stockes of Money nevertheles have not
byn imployed accordinge to the charitable intente of the givers and founders
thereof, by reason of Fraudes breaches of Truste and Negligence in those that
shoulde pay delyver and imploy the same....  31                              
In Vancouver Regional FreeNet Assn. v. M.N.R., [1996] 3 F.C. 880
(C.A.), at p. 885, Hugessen J.A. (like Slade J.
before him in McGovern v. Attorney-General, [1982] Ch. 321, at
p. 332) rendered this archaic style into modern language:  ... relief of aged, impotent, and poor people; the maintenance of sick
and maimed soldiers and mariners, schools of learning, free schools, and
scholars in universities; the repair of bridges, ports, havens, causeways,
churches, sea banks and highways; the education and preferment of orphans; the
relief, stock, or maintenance of houses of correction; marriages of poor maids;
supportation, aid, and help of young tradesmen, handicraftsmen, and persons
decayed; the relief or redemption of prisoners or captives; and the aid or ease
of any poor inhabitants concerning payments of fifteens, setting out of
soldiers, and other taxes.  32                              
The Statute of Elizabeth itself was repealed by the Mortmain
and Charitable Uses Act, 1888 (U.K.), 51 & 52 Vict.,
ch. 42, s. 13(1), though the preamble was retained by operation of
s. 13(2).  However, the 1888 Act, including the preamble, was itself later
repealed by the Charities Act, 1960 (U.K.), 8 & 9 Eliz. 2,
c. 58, s. 38, so no statutory authority for the preamble now exists.  Yet
it is widely recognized that the preamble has been absorbed into the common
law, and thus it has continued to exert considerable influence over this area
of the law.  It will immediately be seen that the preamble provides a list of
examples, rather than a definition, of charitable purposes.  In recognition of
this, the House of Lords undertook a categorization of charitable purposes in
their well-known decision in Pemsel, supra.  In an oft-quoted
passage, Lord Macnaghten observed, at p. 583:  How far then, it may be asked, does the popular meaning of the word
“charity” correspond with its legal meaning?  “Charity” in its legal sense
comprises four principal divisions:  trusts for the relief of poverty; trusts
for the advancement of education; trusts for the advancement of religion; and
trusts for other purposes beneficial to the community, not falling under any of
the preceding heads.  33                              
As Iacobucci J. observes, the Pemsel classification was
approved by this Court in Guaranty Trust Co. of Canada v. Minister of
National Revenue, [1967] S.C.R. 133, at p. 141, where Ritchie J.
noted that it had “received general acceptance in this country”.  This Court
had earlier adopted the outlines of the Pemsel classification (though
not describing it as such) in The King v. Assessors of the Town of Sunny
Brae, [1952] 2 S.C.R. 76, at p. 88.  The Pemsel classification
has been invoked by the Federal Court of Appeal in most cases in the area since
then.  34                              
Two salient features of the Pemsel classification scheme bear
emphasis.  First, the Pemsel scheme must be distinguished from the
preamble to the Statute of Elizabeth.  There is wide agreement that the
preamble was never intended to be, and is not, a complete enumeration of
charitable purposes.  As the full title of the Statute of Elizabeth
makes clear (An Acte to redresse the misemployment of Landes, Goodes and
Stockes of Money heretofore given to Charitable Uses), the purpose of the
statute was to provide a more effective enforcement mechanism to ensure that
charitable property was not misapplied to non-charitable uses.  See
G. Jones, History of the Law of Charity 1532-1827 (1969), at
pp. 57-58.  Thus, although the purposes enumerated in the preamble are
charitable, many other purposes not enumerated in the preamble have also been
accepted as being charitable in law.  This was recognized early on by Sir Lloyd
Kenyon M.R. in Turner v. Ogden (1787), 1 Cox 316, 29 E.R. 1183, at
p. 1183 (“the statute does not affect to mention all”), and has been
followed ever since, as Russell L.J. confirmed in Incorporated Council
of Law Reporting for England and Wales v. Attorney-General, [1972]
Ch. 73 (C.A.), at p. 87.  35                              
Unlike the preamble, Pemsel provides a classification, rather
than an enumeration, of charitable purposes.  The preamble, as we have just
seen, is not exhaustive.  By contrast, the Pemsel classification is
exhaustive:  any purpose which is charitable must fit into one or more of the
four Pemsel categories, although admittedly the fourth category is very
broad due to its residual nature.  Both the Pemsel classification and
the preamble provide a description rather than a definition of charitable
purposes.  Yet neither the Pemsel classification nor the preamble
explain why the purposes they classify or enumerate are charitable:  both
simply assert that they are.  As I explain below, the courts must have resort
to principle in the development of the law of charity.  That said, the Pemsel
classification includes purposes not enumerated in the preamble, of which the
advancement of religion is perhaps the most prominent example.  As well, the Pemsel
classification is pitched at a higher level of abstraction than the preamble,
and for that reason has largely replaced the preamble as the starting point for
the courts in determining whether a particular purpose is charitable.  36                              
Second, I underscore that the Pemsel classification is a flexible
judicial creation, and thus amenable to subsequent change and development.  The
Pemsel scheme has been described as “a classification of convenience”
which “must not be given the force of a statute”:  Scottish Burial Reform
and Cremation Society Ltd. v. Glasgow Corporation, [1968] A.C. 138 (H.L.),
at p. 154.  The courts have on several occasions emphasized that the
categories of charity are not closed, and that the purposes considered to be
charitable at law evolve with social developments.  See, e.g., Scottish
Burial Reform, at p. 154; In re Strakosch, [1949] Ch. 529
(C.A.), at p. 537.  This innate flexibility has enabled the courts to
modernize the law of charity in recognition of changing social needs.  The
purposes listed in the preamble illustrate purposes seen as proper objects of
charity, having regard to the social needs of the time.  The wide range of
purposes set out in the preamble — ranging from the “repair of bridges” to the
maintenance of “schools of learning” and the “relief or redemption of prisoners
or captives” — indicates that the Tudor conception of charity was very broad. 
The Pemsel classification provides a framework within which the courts
may adapt the law as those social needs change.  Of course, the courts must be
guided by principle when determining whether a particular purpose is
charitable.  In the absence of clearly defined principles in this area, the
courts (and perhaps more importantly, administrative decision makers, such as
the Minister, who rely on judicial decisions) may become too wedded to outdated
conceptions of the existing categories and lose sight of the underlying
principles which motivate the law of charity.  37                              
Two central principles have long been embedded in the case law. 
Speaking of the existing Pemsel categories, Rand J. observed in Sunny
Brae, supra, at p. 88, that “the attributes attaching to all
are their voluntariness and, directly or indirectly, their reflex on public
welfare”.  These two principles, namely, (1) voluntariness (or what I shall
refer to as altruism, that is, giving to third parties without receiving
anything in return other than the pleasure of giving); and (2) public welfare
or benefit in an objectively measurable sense, underlie the existing categories
of charitable purposes, and should be the touchstones guiding their further
development.  38                              
Before turning to the substance of this appeal, it is useful to review
two key elements of the law of charity as a background for the consideration of
what follows.  These principles originated in the law of trusts, and have been
modified slightly with the advent of the ITA  regime.  The first is the
principle of exclusivity.  To qualify as charitable, the purposes of an
organization or trust must be exclusively charitable:  Guaranty Trust, supra,
at p. 143 (citing British Launderers’ Research Association v. Borough
of Hendon Rating Authority, [1949] 1 K.B. 462 (C.A.), at p. 467), and Jones
v. T. Eaton Co., [1973] S.C.R. 635, at p. 641.  The exclusivity
requirement is also reflected in the ITA  itself.  The definition of
“charitable organization” contained in s. 149.1(1)  specifies that “all
the resources” of the organization must be “devoted to charitable activities
carried on by the organization itself”, and that “no part of the income”
of the organization may personally benefit a “proprietor, member, shareholder,
trustee or settlor” (emphasis added).  39                              
The primary reason for the exclusivity requirement is, as Slade J.
observed in McGovern, supra, at p. 340, that if charitable
organizations were permitted to pursue a mixture of charitable and
non-charitable purposes, there could be no certainty that donations to them
would be channelled to the pursuit of charitable purposes.  See also Brewer
v. McCauley, [1954] S.C.R. 645, at pp. 646-47.  The ITA
imposes, in s. 149.1(1) , a further requirement that a charitable
organization must devote all of its resources to charitable activities. 
The importance of this requirement is discussed in greater detail below.  At
this point, I wish only to highlight the distinction between charitable
purposes and charitable activities.  40                              
It is essential to appreciate, as my colleague Iacobucci J. does,
that the exclusivity requirement does not quite mean what it says, a position
this Court affirmed in Guaranty Trust, supra, at p. 143.  It
has long been accepted that the pursuit of purposes which, though not
charitable in themselves, are merely ancillary or incidental to the fulfilment
of the primary, charitable, purposes of an organization will not cause the
organization to run afoul of the exclusivity requirement.  At a certain point,
of course, a purpose may grow to assume a collateral rather than incidental
nature.  If so, it will no longer be a means to the fulfilment of the
organization’s primary purposes, but will have become an end in itself.  If the
collateral purpose is not itself charitable, its pursuit will render the
organization in breach of the exclusivity requirement.  41                              
A second requirement for charitable status is, as Iacobucci J.
confirms,  that the purposes of the trust or organization must be “[f]or the
benefit of the community or of an appreciably important class of the
community”, as Ritchie J. stated in Guaranty Trust, supra,
at p. 141 (citing Verge v. Somerville, [1924] A.C. 496 (P.C.), at
p. 499).  The public benefit requirement has two distinct components. 
There must be an objectively measurable and socially useful benefit
conferred; and it must be a benefit available to a sufficiently large section
of the population to be considered a public benefit.  As will be seen
below, although the public benefit requirement applies to all charitable
purposes, it is of particular concern under the fourth head of Lord
Macnaghten’s scheme in Pemsel:  see Inland Revenue Commissioners v.
Baddeley, [1955] A.C. 572 (H.L.), at p. 590.  This is so because under
the first three heads, public benefit is essentially a rebuttable presumption,
whereas under the fourth head it must be demonstrated:  National
Anti-Vivisection Society v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, [1948] A.C. 31
(H.L.), at p. 42.  Although the requirement of public benefit is raised
only obliquely on the facts of this appeal, it is essential to keep in mind in
any consideration of an application for status as a registered charity.  I now
turn to consider whether the Minister erred in refusing to register the Society
as a charitable organization.  C.  The
Proper Test for Determining the Charitable Nature of a Purpose   42                              
I begin by addressing the proper approach to the determination of
whether a particular purpose is charitable in law.  It is widely accepted that
the courts must begin with the Pemsel classification and determine
whether the purposes of the organization under consideration may be placed
within one or more of the categories contained therein.  The Pemsel
classification carves out three presumptively charitable categories (relief of
poverty, advancement of education, and advancement of religion) and creates a residual
fourth category of charitable purposes (“other purposes beneficial to the
community”), which itself comprises a number of recognized subcategories.  As I
explain below, distinct considerations apply to the fourth head.  In
determining whether a given purpose is charitable, the courts adhere to the
analogical approach to legal reasoning familiar to the common law.  However,
unlike the preamble, the Pemsel classification does not itself provide
any enumeration of purposes from which to analogize to putatively charitable
purposes under consideration.  Consequently, the courts continue to look to the
preamble when considering purposes classified under the fourth head of the Pemsel
scheme.  As this Court indicated in Blais v. Touchet, [1963] S.C.R. 358,
at p. 360, the distinctions drawn by the courts in this area may at times
be extremely fine.  “The pursuit of these analogies”, Chitty J. confirmed
in In re Foveaux, [1895] 2 Ch. 501, at p. 504, “obviously requires
caution and circumspection”.  43                              
The authorities are littered with statements bemoaning the confusion
that may result in the course of an analysis of the fourth head of the Pemsel
classification.  Hugessen J.A. recently observed in Vancouver Regional
FreeNet Assn., supra, at p. 886, that the fourth head has been
“the source of confusion and difficulty”.  See also the comments of Viscount
Simonds in Baddeley, supra, at p. 583.  Yet the task is not
nearly so complicated.  The leading Canadian authority on the scope of the
fourth head of the Pemsel classification scheme is Native
Communications Society, supra.  In that case, Stone J.A.
held, at pp. 479-80:  A review of decided cases suggests that at least
the following propositions may be stated as necessary preliminaries to a determination
whether a particular purpose can be regarded as a charitable one falling under
the fourth head found in Lord Macnaghten’s classification:  (a) the purpose must be beneficial to the community in a way which the
law regards as charitable by coming within the “spirit and intendment” of the
preamble to the Statute of Elizabeth if not within its letter.  (National
Anti-Vivisection Society v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, [1948] A.C. 31
(H.L.), at pages 63-64; In re Strakosch, decd. Temperley v. Attorney-General,
[1949] Ch. 529 (C.A.), at pages 537-538), and (b) whether a purpose would or may operate for the public benefit is to
be answered by the court on the basis of the record before it and in exercise
of its equitable jurisdiction in matters of charity (National
Anti-Vivisection Society v. Inland Revenue Commissioners (supra), at
pages 44-45, 63).  44                              
When considering a purpose under the fourth head of the Pemsel
classification, the courts must determine whether the purpose may be placed
within the language of the preamble, or whether an analogy may be made with a
purpose contained in the preamble.  Courts have then taken the next step, and
have drawn new analogies to purposes themselves already deemed analogous to
those contained in the preamble.  Thus, the courts begin with the language of
the preamble, but do not limit themselves to it.  They speak of looking to
whether the purpose under consideration fits within the preamble’s “spirit and
intendment”, or of the “equity of the Statute”:  Scottish Burial
Reform, supra, at p. 147; Law Reporting case, supra,
at p. 89.  Reference to the “spirit and intendment” of the preamble has
actually overtaken reference to the preamble itself.  Thus, in Scottish
Burial Reform, at p. 154, Lord Wilberforce said that the “spirit and
intendment” requirement  does not mean quite what it says; for it is now accepted that what must
be regarded is not the wording of the preamble itself, but the effect of
decisions given by the courts as to its scope, decisions which have endeavoured
to keep the law as to charities moving according as new social needs arise or
old ones become obsolete or satisfied.  45                              
The authorities provide that the mere fact that a purpose is of public
benefit does not, without more, render that purpose charitable.  Only a
subcategory of purposes which benefit the public are charitable.  To qualify as
charitable, a purpose must be beneficial to the public “in a way which the law
regards as charitable”:  Williams’ Trustees v. Inland Revenue Commissioners,
[1947] A.C. 447 (H.L.), at p. 455; Positive Action Against Pornography,
supra, at p. 350.  This sounds circular, but the boundary marking
off the subcategory — distinguishing those purposes considered to be beneficial
“in a way which the law regards as charitable” — is established by the “spirit
and intendment” requirement.  The “spirit and intendment” requirement simply
directs the courts to ensure that the purpose at issue is of the same type or
nature as those enumerated in the preamble:  Vancouver Regional FreeNet
Assn., supra, at p. 891; In re Strakosch, supra,
at p. 537; Peggs v. Lamb, [1994] 2 All E.R. 15
(Ch. D.), at p. 33.  46                              
A helpful encapsulation of these considerations may be found in Lord
Wilberforce’s speech in D’Aguiar v. Guyana Commissioner of Inland Revenue,
[1970]  T.R. 31 (P.C.), at p. 33:  The difficulties inherent in the definition of the
fourth heading have been well exemplified in the decisions of the Courts both
before and since 1891.  An attempt has been made to give it greater precision
by adding to the phrase  “purposes beneficial to the community”  the qualifications  “in a way the law regard [sic] as charitable”,  and  “within the spirit and intendment of the preamble to the Statute of
Elizabeth” (43 Eliz. I c. 4.)  But these are not the clearest of guidelines.  The first brings the
argument round in a circle close to its starting-point; the second throws one
back upon an enumeration with no common character, many centuries out of date. 
But the process which the Court must follow, however difficult, is now fairly
well established.  It must first consider the trend of those decisions which
have established certain objects as charitable under this heading, and ask
whether, by reasonable extension or analogy, the instant case may be considered
to be in line with these.  Secondly, it must examine certain accepted anomalies
to see whether they fairly cover the objects under consideration.  Thirdly —
and  this is really a cross-check upon the others — it must ask whether,
consistently with the objects declared, the income and property in question can
be applied for purposes clearly falling outside the scope of charity:  if so, the
argument for charity must fail.  47                              
Out of a certain degree of frustration, some courts have focused upon
the conception of public benefit itself as the touchstone of charitable status
under the fourth head of the Pemsel classification, with minimal resort
to the “spirit and intendment” of the preamble of the Statute of Elizabeth
as a further limiting factor.  In the Law Reporting case, supra,
both Russell L.J., at pp. 88-89, and Sachs L.J., at p. 94,
favoured such an approach, which essentially eliminates the requirement that
the purpose be demonstrated to be for the public benefit in a way the law
regards as charitable.  On this account, once it is demonstrated
that a purpose is for the public benefit, it should be considered prima
facie charitable, barring compelling policy grounds to deem the purpose
non-charitable.  48                              
Although dropping the requirement that a purpose must be for the public
benefit in a way the law recognizes as charitable is not without its
attractions, it is not easily reconcilable with earlier authorities (see on
this point Royal National Agricultural and Industrial Association v. Chester
(1974), 3 A.L.R. 486 (H.C.), at p. 489).  Moreover, I also share my
colleague’s concern that the adoption of such an approach by this Court would
tend to blur the ITA ’s distinction between charitable organizations and non-profit
organizations.  I might add, however, that I am not persuaded that the approach
I adopt in these reasons does anything to weaken that distinction.  The
requirement that a charitable organization must pursue a public benefit in a
way which the law regards as charitable should be maintained.  Nonetheless, in
determining whether a purpose is for the public benefit in a way which the law
regards as charitable, we must recall that the legal conception of charity must
evolve, and respond to social developments.  We must adhere to principle as
well as precedent.  49                              
The best approach, in my view, is one which marries adherence to
principle with respect for the existing categories as established by the Pemsel
scheme.  We must avoid the Scylla of blind adherence to an inflexible
enumeration of charitable purposes, by testing purported purposes against broad
principles.  At the same time, we must bypass the Charybdis of attempting to
evaluate the charitable status of a purpose by simple reference to an abstract
principle — public benefit — without the benefit of analogical reasoning and
the common law inheritance of authorities.  I have in mind a similar approach
to that which this Court has adopted to the law of unjust enrichment. 
McLachlin J., writing for the majority of this Court in Peel (Regional
Municipality) v. Canada, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 762, spoke of the need to find a
balance between what she termed the “category” and the “principled” approaches
in the law of unjust enrichment.  I find this to be of assistance in
illustrating the path that should be taken in the law of charity.  It would be
unwise to jettison the vast historical inheritance associated with judicial
development of the law of charity, although I do think it appropriate to ensure
that the existing common law accords with certain identifiable principles which
should guide the development of this area of law as a whole.  50                              
How then should the Court undertake the task of modernizing the existing
categories of charitable purposes?  One commentator, reflecting on the
observation made above that neither the preamble nor the Pemsel
classification purport to define charitable purposes, has suggested that the
preamble is best viewed as an agenda for social improvement: 
E. B. Bromley, “Contemporary Philanthropy — Is the Legal Concept of
“Charity” Any Longer Adequate?”, in D. W. M. Waters, ed., Equity,
Fiduciaries and Trusts 1993 (1993), 59, at pp. 65-66.  Our perceptions
as to what should and should not be included on that agenda have changed over
the centuries, as they will continue to do.  New social needs arise, and old
social problems decline in importance.  Consequently, it would be a mistake to
make a fetish of the purposes enumerated in preamble.  Rather, the Court should
adhere to the principles of altruism and public benefit, to which I adverted
above, in order to identify new charitable purposes and to ensure that existing
ones continue to serve the public good.  The law should reflect the realization
that although the particular purposes seen as worthy of pursuit change over
time, the principles of which they are instantiations endure.  51                              
Thus, in determining whether a particular purpose is charitable, the
courts must look to both broad principles — altruism and public benefit — as
well as the existing case law under the Pemsel classification.  The
courts should consider whether the purpose under consideration is analogous to
one of the purposes enumerated in the preamble of the Statute of Elizabeth,
or build analogy upon analogy.  Yet the pursuit of analogy should not lead the
courts astray.  One’s eye must always be upon the broader principles I have
identified, which are the Ariadne’s thread running through the Pemsel
categories, and the individual purposes recognized as charitable under them. 
The courts should not shy away from the recognition of new purposes which
respond to pressing social needs.  D.  The
Distinction Between Charitable Purposes and Charitable Activities  52                              
In the law of charity, the courts’ primary concern is to determine
whether the purposes being pursued are charitable.  It is these purposes
which are essential, not the activities engaged in, although the
activities must, of course, bear a coherent relationship to the purposes sought
to be achieved.  (I pause to emphasize that motive and purpose are not
synonymous.  The courts are not, in general, concerned with the motive of a
donor or volunteer, only with the purpose being pursued.)  A common source of
confusion in this area is that judges and commentators alike often conflate the
concept of “charitable purposes” and “charitable activities”.  The former is a
long-established concept in the common law of charitable trusts.  The latter is
a much more recent innovation:  it is contained in the ITA , but has no
history in the common law. The distinction between charitable purposes
and activities was identified by Ritchie J. for this Court in Guaranty
Trust, supra, at p. 147.  Subsequently, that distinction has
been the subject of comment in a number of decisions of the Federal Court of
Appeal, including Scarborough Community Legal Services v. The Queen,
[1985] 2 F.C. 555, at p. 579; Toronto Volgograd Committee v.
M.N.R., [1988] 3 F.C. 251; and Everywoman’s Health Centre Society, supra.  53                              
A critical difference between purposes and activities is that purposes
may be defined in the abstract as being either charitable or not, but the same
cannot be said about activities.  That is, one may determine whether an
activity is charitable only by reference to a previously identified charitable
purpose(s) the activity is supposed to advance.  The question then becomes one
of determining whether the activity has the effect of furthering the purpose or
not, as Iacobucci J. notes at para. 152. In determining whether an
organization should be registered as a charitable organization, we must, as my
colleague Iacobucci J. indicates, look not only to the purposes for which
it was originally instituted, but also to what the organization actually does,
that is, its activities.  But we must begin by examining the organization’s
purposes, and only then consider whether its activities are sufficiently
related to those purposes.  54                              
In the Law Reporting case, supra, at p. 86,
Russell L.J. illustrated this point by supposing the example of a company
which published the Bible for profit, and compared it to one which published
the Bible without a view to profit, but with the purpose of distributing copies
of it to the public.  In each case, the activity engaged in — publishing the
Bible — is identical.  But the purposes being pursued are very different, and
consequently the status of each company also differs.  Although the former
company clearly would not be pursuing a charitable purpose, the latter almost
certainly would be.  This example demonstrates that an activity, taken in the
abstract, can rarely be deemed charitable or non-charitable.  Rather, it is the
purpose underlying the activity to which the courts must look initially in
assessing whether the activity is charitable.  It must then be determined
whether there is a sufficient degree of connection between the activity engaged
in and the purpose being pursued, but this is a distinct inquiry involving
separate considerations.  Purposes are the ends to be achieved:  activities are
the means by which to accomplish those ends.  Purposes must be evaluated
substantively.  Activities are assessed by determining the degree to which they
actually are instrumental in achieving the organization’s goals.  55                              
It is with this in mind that I consider the two propositions set
forth by  Iacobucci J., at para. 159, as requirements for
registration under s. 248(1)  of the ITA :  (1)  the purposes of the organization must be
charitable, and must define the scope of the activities engaged in by the
organization; and  (2)  all of the organization’s resources must be
devoted to these activities unless the organization falls within the specific
exemptions of s. 149.1(6.1) or (6.2).  With respect,
I do not find my colleague’s formulation to be the most helpful as a framework
for analysis.  I agree with the second requirement my colleague sets out.  I
also agree that the purposes of the organization must be charitable.  However,
I have reservations as to the second clause of his first requirement.  As
Iacobucci J. himself observes, at para. 199, charitable activities
cannot be defined other than by reference to the purposes they are to further.  I
do not necessarily disagree with my colleague’s suggestion that the purposes of
an organization must “define the scope of the activities engaged in by the
organization”, but I find that formulation awkward.  56                              
I consider the key questions to be:  (a) are the organization’s purposes
charitable?  and (b) are the activities the organization engages in
sufficiently related to its purposes to be considered to be furthering them?  I
would, therefore, reformulate my colleague’s first proposition into two parts: 
(a) an organization must be constituted exclusively for charitable purposes;
and (b) its activities must be substantially connected to, and in furtherance
of, those purposes.  So, when Iacobucci J. states, at para. 160, that
“[i]n the end, while it is true that at least some of the Society’s purposes
contemplate charitable activities, it cannot be said that they restrict the
Society to charitable activities alone”, this strikes me as a roundabout way of
contending that either (a) not all of the Society’s purposes are charitable; or
(b) even if the Society’s purposes are charitable, not all of its activities
are sufficiently connected to its purposes.  57                              
One theory, which has obtained some currency in the Federal Court of
Appeal, takes note of the fact that the ITA ’s references to “charitable
purposes” are with regard to “charitable foundations”, whereas its references
to “charitable activities” occur in the context of “charitable organizations”: 
ITA, s. 149.1(1) .  In Toronto Volgograd Committee, supra,
at p. 257, Marceau J.A. considered this distinction to be
“fundamental” to the legislative scheme, because only charitable organizations
may undertake activities.  See also Scarborough Community Legal Services,
supra, at pp. 578-79.  Charitable foundations, by contrast, exist
only to fund the activities of other persons; they do not undertake activities
themselves.  It therefore followed, in Marceau J.A.’s view, that an
evaluation of a charitable organization necessarily entailed a focus on the
organization’s activities.  58                              
Marceau J.A. was surely right to hold that the courts must
scrutinize the activities of a would-be charitable organization, and that the
courts should not confine their gaze to the applicant’s constituting document. 
But that proposition does not displace my earlier observation that the courts
must evaluate the charitable nature of activities by reference to their degree
of relationship with the charitable purposes which they purport to advance. 
Marceau J.A. himself recognized that the evaluation must be an objective
one:  the intention of the organization in undertaking the activity cannot
govern its status.  Marceau J.A. doubted that an organization’s activities
could be “rationally classified on the sole basis of their more or less
close proximity to the general purposes for which the group was organized”:  Scarborough
Community Legal Services, supra, at p. 579 (emphasis added). 
Nevertheless, though not the “sole” basis for classification, the degree of
connection between the activity and the charitable purpose which it furthers
must be the primary consideration in the determination as to whether an
activity is charitable.  59                              
Despite the language of the ITA , at least one prominent
commentator strongly doubts whether such a thing as a “charitable activity” can
be said to exist at all:  see M. C. Cullity, “The Myth of Charitable
Activities” (1990), 10 Est. & Tr. J. 7.  That is, activities
cannot be characterized as charitable or non-charitable in the abstract, but
only by reference to the purposes which they further.  It is true that some
activities have been deemed to be non-charitable in and of themselves, such as
those which are illegal or contrary to public policy (Everywoman’s Health
Centre Society, supra, at p. 67), or specifically prohibited by
the ITA  (e.g., the political activities enumerated in
s. 149.1(6.2) (c)), but they are not at issue in this appeal.  60                              
The best way to conceptualize the issue, in my view, is to begin from the
proposition, adverted to above, that a charitable organization must be
constituted for exclusively charitable purposes.  To this end, a charitable
organization may engage in activities that accomplish or further those
charitable purposes.  For example, the ITA  specifically provides that a
charitable organization may engage in political activities in
furtherance of its exclusively charitable purposes, so long as those
political activities are “ancillary and incidental” to those charitable
purposes.  In effect, the ITA  deems such activities to be charitable
activities.  However, as I discuss in more detail below, it is equally clear
that a charitable organization may not pursue political purposes at
all.  Similarly, a charitable organization may operate a commercial enterprise,
so long as the enterprise serves as a means of accomplishing the purposes of
the organization, rather than an end in itself.  See, e.g., Alberta
Institute on Mental Retardation v. Canada, [1987] 3 F.C. 286 (C.A.), at
p. 295, leave to appeal refused, [1988] 1 S.C.R. xiii.  Again, the key
consideration is the nexus between the activity in question and the charitable
purpose to be served.   62                              
Some question may also arise as to the degree of “sufficient connection”
between the activity under scrutiny and the purpose it is meant to serve.  In Toronto
Volgograd Committee, supra, at p. 259, Marceau J.A. held
that activities must “be considered with respect to their immediate result and
effect, not their possible eventual consequence”.  That is, there must be a
direct, rather than an indirect, relationship between the activity and the
purpose it serves.  That is the position taken by Iacobucci J. in the
present appeal.  I agree.  However, I would be reluctant to interpret “direct”
as “immediate”.  All that is required is that there be a coherent relationship
between the activity and the purpose, such that the activity can be said to be
furthering the purpose. 63                              
Thus, in my view, the proper approach is to begin by:  (a) identifying
the primary purposes of the organization; and then (b) determining whether
those purposes are charitable.  If one concludes that the purposes are not
charitable, then the organization is not charitable, and the inquiry ends
there.  However, if the organization’s primary purposes are charitable, we must
then go a further step, and consider (c) whether the other purposes pursued by
the organization are ancillary or incidental to its primary purposes; and (d)
whether the activities engaged in by the organization are sufficiently related
to its purposes to be considered to be furthering them.  If positive responses
are made to these two latter inquiries, then the organization should be
registered as a charitable organization.  E.  Application
to the Present Appeal  64                              
I come now to the application of the approach I have outlined above to
the facts as set out in the record before us.  I wish to emphasize that the
factual record in this appeal is very modest, as I suspect it is in the vast
majority of cases involving an application for registration as a charitable
organization under the ITA .  This is so for at least two reasons. 
First, Revenue Canada’s decision as to whether to register an applicant as a
registered charity is a “strictly administrative function” and is made without
a hearing:  Scarborough Community Legal Services, supra,
at p. 576.  Although Revenue Canada may request written submissions and
further information from an applicant, it is under no obligation to do so.  65                              
Second, s. 180(3) of the ITA  specifically provides that
appeals taken to the Federal Court of Appeal pursuant to s. 172(3)  of the ITA 
“shall be heard and determined in a summary way”.  As the Federal Court of
Appeal recently observed in Human Life International in Canada Inc. v.
M.N.R., [1998] 3 F.C. 202, at para. 1, the effect of s. 180(3)  is
that the Federal Court of Appeal “must therefore review the relevant questions
of law and fact without the benefit of any findings of fact by a trial court
and indeed without the benefit of any sworn evidence”.  The present appeal
procedure has been cogently criticized elsewhere (see, e.g.,
D. W. Smith, “Tax appeal procedure for charities needs improving” (The
National, vol. 12, No. 4, April 1985, at p. 21), and
its failures are manifest in the present appeal.  It is essential, in my view,
that those failures not be ascribed to the Society.  66                              
It must also be remembered that an organization may seek registration as
a charitable organization at any number of stages in its existence.  Many
applications involve new organizations which, by definition, have no “track
record” of which to speak.  In evaluating the putative charitable status of the
purposes and activities of such an organization, Revenue Canada (and the
courts) must necessarily rely almost entirely upon the constituting documents
of the organization.  I do not for a moment wish to be taken as suggesting that
Revenue Canada has no power to request further information or clarification
from an applicant.  Obviously, Revenue Canada must receive enough information
to ascertain whether the applicant’s purposes are prima facie
charitable, and it should also be entitled to request information to determine
whether the activities that the applicant engages in are merely subordinate to,
and in direct furtherance of, its purposes.  The Federal Court of Appeal
recently noted in Stop the Violence . . . Face the Music Society v. The
Queen, 97 D.T.C. 5026, that “[s]ince the benefits attaching to charitable
status are significant, the onus is on those seeking this status to clearly
demonstrate that their activities are clearly focused on charitable objects in
the legal sense”.  Nevertheless, I do emphasize that there are limits as to
what Revenue Canada may reasonably expect an applicant to provide.  Indeed, it
must not be forgotten, as my colleague recognizes, that for many applicants,
the ability to engage in any activities at all may depend upon their ability to
obtain registered charity status, and so be entitled to provide tax receipts to
donors.  67                              
In the present appeal, Revenue Canada appears to treat registration as a
charitable organization as a once-and-for-all determination, and thus argues in
favour of a restrictive approach to registration.  The view that once granted,
an organization is a charitable organization forever, so that Revenue Canada
adopt a restrictive gatekeeping function, strikes me as mistaken.  Charitable
registration is always subject to revocation in the future, pursuant to
ss. 149.1(2) , 149.1(4.1) , or s. 168  of the ITA , should Revenue
Canada take the view that an organization has ceased to comply with applicable
legal requirements.  Moreover, registered charities are obligated by
s. 230(2)  of the ITA  to maintain books and records to enable
Revenue Canada to determine whether there are any grounds for revocation of
registration, and are required by s. 149.1(14)  to provide Revenue Canada
with an annual information return.  Because the consequences of deregistration
are draconian (on which see s. 188(1)  of the ITA ), registered charities
have obvious ongoing incentives to comply with the ITA ’s requirements.  68                              
The Society’s purpose is set out in clause 2(a) of its
constitution.  In examining this purpose, we must, as Scott J. indicated
in Attorney General v. Ross, [1985] 3 All E.R. 334 (Ch. D.), at
p. 342, read an organization’s constitution as a whole, and consider it in
the context of its factual background.  Each of the other purposes set out in
clauses 2(b), (c) and (e) are merely subsidiary to, and in direct furtherance
of, this purpose.  The Society’s purpose, as clause 2(a) states, is “to
provide educational forums, classes, workshops and seminars to immigrant women
in order that they may be able to find or obtain employment or self
employment”.  Thus, the Society proposes to engage in certain activities (the
provision of educational forums, classes, workshops and seminars) for the
benefit of a class (immigrant women) to achieve a goal (to enable the class of
beneficiaries to obtain employment or self employment).  At this stage, we are
concerned only with the purpose itself, but it should be evident that the
purpose cannot be distinguished entirely from the activities which purport to
further it.  69                              
The Society submits, as it did before the Federal Court of Appeal, that
its purpose may be placed within the second and fourth of the Pemsel
categories, that is, being for the “advancement of education” as well as being
for “other purposes beneficial to the community”.  I should indicate at this
point that the Pemsel categories are not mutually exclusive.  A purpose
may well fit into more than one category.  Equally, an organization may pursue
a mixture of purposes, so long as each one of those purposes can be placed
within at least one of the four Pemsel categories.  Thus, in the present
appeal, the Society need succeed under only one of the Pemsel
categories.  70                              
Perhaps surprisingly, the Society did not put forward the argument that
its purpose could be placed within the “relief of poverty” category of the Pemsel
classification.  The Society did advance this argument in its initial letter to
Revenue Canada of March 17, 1993, but it does not appear to have been
pursued any further.  There is authority for the proposition that the relief of
poverty among the unemployed is charitable, regardless of whether such relief
is provided directly through financial relief, or indirectly “by training
individuals so that they are able to earn a living or helping them to find
work”:  E. Cairns, Charities:  Law and Practice (3rd ed.
1997), at p. 5.  Courts have in recent years outlined a more expansive
definition of “relief of poverty”, which takes into account the movement away
from simply providing direct financial assistance to the provision of services
to enable the poor to become economically independent:  Inland Revenue
Commissioners v. Oldham Training and Enterprise Council, [1996] B.T.C. 539
(Ch. D.), at pp. 553-54.  More might have been made of this. 
However, as the argument was not pursued before us, I shall say no more about
it here.  (1)  Advancement of Education  71                              
A central issue in this appeal, then, is whether the Society’s purpose
fits within the second category set out in Pemsel, namely, “the
advancement of education”.  If not, we must consider whether that category should
be expanded to include the Society’s purpose, or whether it might be placed
within another category.   73                              
Does the Society’s purpose fit within the advancement of education
head?  Iacobucci J. accepts that the approach described above is an
accurate reflection of the law, and concludes that Revenue Canada and the
Federal Court of Appeal were thus correct in deciding that the Society did not
meet the requirements for registration.  Iacobucci J. relies, at
para. 161, upon a passage from Maclean Hunter Ltd. v. Deputy Minister
of National Revenue for Customs and Excise, 88 D.T.C. 6096 (F.C.A.), in
support of a narrow definition, and concludes that the classes, workshops and
seminars which the Society proposes are not of this nature, because they have
an “immediately utilitarian focus” (p. 6098).  I note that
Iacobucci J.’s objection appears to be to the Society’s activities, rather
than its purpose.  Nonetheless, Iacobucci J. goes on to hold that the
traditional definition of “advancement of education” embodied in the existing
law should be abandoned in favour of a broader, more modern approach.  Like
Iacobucci J., I underscore that Maclean Hunter was not a case
concerned with the law of charity, but was instead concerned with an exemption
contained in the Excise Tax Act .  This was not acknowledged when Maclean
Hunter’s definition of “education” was adopted in the Briarpatch
case.  This observation does not, in itself, disqualify the definition of
education adopted in Maclean Hunter from consideration, but it does
highlight its limitations.  74                              
I agree with my colleague’s proposal to adopt a more modern conception
of “advancement of education”, although my own view is that the “more
inclusive” approach he favours was already latent in the authorities.  For
example, in Re Central Employment Bureau for Women and Students’ Careers
Association Inc., [1942] 1 All E.R. 232 (Ch. D.), a fund “solely for
the purpose of helping educated women and girls to become self-supporting” was
upheld as charitable.  Simonds J. considered that a gift for the purpose
of educating women in such a manner as will be most conducive to their earning
a living was charitable as being for the “advancement of education”.  He found
himself, at p. 233, unable to distinguish “a gift for the advancement of
education in general terms and a gift for the purpose of educating individuals
in such manner as will be most conducive to their earning their living”. 
Simonds J. held further that the fund could be considered charitable as
being for the relief of poverty, because a gift to enable persons to become
self-sufficient necessarily implies that they are “on the poverty side of the
borderline”.  I do not believe that Central Employment Bureau can be
meaningfully distinguished from the present appeal.  In both cases, the
beneficiaries are to receive support to pursue training so as to become
self-sufficient.  In Central Employment Bureau, the fund assisted “educated
women” (emphasis added).  The Society assists immigrant women to obtain
employment or self-employment:  many are educated women, although some are
not.  I do not think anything turns on this.  As in Central Employment
Bureau, the Society itself does not provide its beneficiaries with
vocational training.  Rather, the Society’s purpose is to educate its
beneficiaries in the more intangible, but no less important, art of putting
their vocational skills into practice in the Canadian workplace.  75                              
When reviewing the authorities which have defined the scope of the
concept of “advancement of education”, one must be careful to appreciate the
context in which each particular definition has been advanced.  So, for
example, it has been a recurring theme of the jurisprudence in this area that
the advancement of education must be clearly distinguished from the pursuit of
political purposes:  Positive Action Against Pornography, supra,
at pp. 348-49.  It is perhaps unsurprising that in making this
distinction, Stone J.A. should emphasize that the mere “presentation to
the public of selected items of information and opinion on the subject of
pornography” could not be considered charitable.  In so doing, Stone J.A.
stressed the formal and systematic nature of education.  Like Iacobucci J.,
I suspect that the true ground of decision was not that the mode of education
selected by the organization in that case was too informal, but rather that the
organization was seeking to advance a particular point of view, and gain
adherents to it, instead of educating members of the public about a certain
subject matter and allowing them to come to their own conclusions.  76                              
These relatively narrow conceptions of “advancement of education”,
though perhaps appropriate for the particular contexts in which they were
adopted, seem to me inappropriate as general definitions for the law of
charity.  The situation, as I see it, is not so much a need to engage in a
wholesale redefinition of “education”, but instead to recognize that many
existing definitions have erred on the side of caution due to the circumstances
in which they were promulgated.  Like Iacobucci J., I believe that a truer
picture of the proper scope to be given to education is contained in Inland
Revenue Commissioners v. McMullen, [1981] A.C. 1 (H.L.), at p. 15. 
There, Lord Hailsham emphasized that the definition of charity is not static,
and that this was particularly the case with the “advancement of education”
head of the Pemsel classification.  The scope of that category changes
and evolves.  I am not persuaded that the existing approach to the scope of the
“advancement of education” head of the Pemsel classification is
warranted in the closing years of the twentieth century.  Nor, I should add, is
that approach necessarily faithful to the authorities.  77                              
I agree with the definition of education proposed by Iacobucci J.,
at para. 169:  Thus, so long as information or training is provided in a structured
manner and for a genuinely educational purpose -- that is, to advance the
knowledge or abilities of the recipients -- and not solely to promote a
particular point of view or political orientation, it may properly be viewed as
falling within the advancement of education.  78                              
I also agree with my colleague’s concern that in order to be educational
under this head, an organization must pursue “actual teaching” or a “learning
component” (para. 171).  However, the Court must maintain as clear a
boundary as possible between charitable and non-charitable purposes.  One
reason why the authorities have attempted to circumscribe narrowly the scope of
the “advancement of education” head is out of concern that if very informal
educational activities were to be considered charitable, it might prove
difficult to prevent the relentless expansion of the scope of the category on
any principled basis.  The more that purposes stray from traditional
conceptions of education, the more difficult it will be to engage in the task
of distinguishing charitable from non-charitable purposes.  I share Lord
Hailsham’s concern (expressed in McMullen, supra, at p. 17)
that the concept of education is not amenable to “indefinite extension”. 
Whatever the outer boundaries of the concept, however, they are not traversed
on the facts of the present appeal.  79                              
Iacobucci J.’s position is that although the Society’s purpose is
charitable under the second head of the Pemsel scheme (para. 173),
not all of the Society’s activities are charitable (paras. 195 and 204). 
I fully agree that the “advancement of education” head encompasses the
Society’s purpose.  Accordingly, it is my view that the Society is prima
facie charitable because its purpose is charitable under a head of the Pemsel
classification.  With respect, I cannot accept Iacobucci J.’s contention
that the Society is engaging in non-charitable activities, but I defer
discussion of that issue until later in these reasons.  However, before doing
so, I think it useful to consider whether the Society’s purpose may also be
placed under another head of the Pemsel categorization, namely, the
residual fourth head.  (2)  Other Purposes Beneficial to the Community  80                              
Thus far, I have concluded that the Society’s purpose fits within the “advancement
of education” category.  I must now consider the Society’s contention that its
purpose fits within the fourth category of Lord Macnaghten’s test in Pemsel,
namely, “trusts for other purposes beneficial to the community, not falling
under any of the preceding heads”.  Iacobucci J. argues that although the
Society’s purpose is charitable under the “advancement of education” head, not
all of its activities are sufficiently connected to that purpose for them to be
considered “charitable activities”.  He also maintains that although those
activities might be sufficiently related to the purpose of assisting immigrants
to obtain employment, that purpose is not charitable, and so again, those
activities are not charitable.  81                              
Regrettably, in my view, the Society expended little effort on locating
authority to support its argument that its purpose qualifies as charitable
under the fourth head of the Pemsel scheme.  Instead, the Society
concentrated its efforts on urging this Court to engage in a wholesale revision
of the common law definition of charity.  This is most unfortunate.  No such
revision is necessary, in my view, because the Society’s purpose can be placed
within the existing Pemsel categories.  The Society was, consequently,
too quick to ask this Court to make new law and insufficiently attentive to the
possibility of succeeding under the existing regime.  Before asking this Court
to modify the common law, litigants should demonstrate that they have exhausted
the possibilities of the existing law.  In the law of charity, those
possibilities are considerable.  82                              
The intervener Canadian Centre for Philanthropy showed the way forward
by bringing to our attention that assisting the settlement of migrants,
immigrants and refugees, and their integration into national life, is a
charitable purpose already recognized under the fourth head of the Pemsel
classification.  In my view, the Society’s purpose is subsumed within this
subcategory.  Although my colleague Iacobucci J. is not persuaded, there
appears to me to be considerable authority in support of this position.  83                              
An early Australian decision, In re Wallace, [1908] V.L.R. 636
(S.C.), upheld the validity of a trust to pay passage money to immigrants from
an English town to Melbourne under the relief of poverty head.  However,
Hood J. also ventured the proposition, at p. 640, that in view of
Australian immigration legislation, “a bequest in aid of immigration might
probably be for the direct benefit of this community”, although we would now
shrink from endorsing his view that “such a bequest would ... have to be much
more guarded than the present one is in point of both mental and physical
qualification of the immigrants”.  I find my colleague’s explanation of
Hood J.’s obiter dictum to be unpersuasive.  Hood J.’s
suggestion, at p. 640, that “there are divergent opinions on the subject”
as to whether assistance to immigrants is a charitable purpose was merely an
acknowledgement that others might disagree with his decision.  My colleague
rightly emphasizes that the existence of a public benefit is a necessary but
not sufficient condition to finding a charitable purpose, but nothing in Wallace,
or indeed, in the manner in which I rely on that case here, denies that
well-established proposition.  84                              
I agree with my colleague that the mere existence of legislation in a
field is not conclusive evidence that an organization pursuing a purpose in
accordance with that legislation is pursuing a public benefit as that latter
term is understood in the law of charity.  However, I see no evidence that
Hood J. relied upon the mere existence of Australian immigration
legislation as conclusive on the issue of public benefit.  Rather, Hood J.
viewed the immigration laws as persuasive, though not conclusive, evidence favouring
the recognition of assistance to immigrants as a charitable purpose.  In so
doing, he treated the existence of legislation in the same field as a relevant,
though not a decisive, consideration.  I see no problem with that: it is
precisely what the Federal Court of Appeal did in Everywoman’s Health Centre
Society, supra, at pp. 67-68.  85                              
In Re Stone (1970), 91 W.N. (N.S.W.) 704 (S.C.), a trust to
assist migration was held to be charitable.  Helsham J. observed, at
p. 718, that “[a] trust to further the purposes of a body whose objects
and activities are the encouragement and settlement of migrants generally in
pursuance of a policy of the community and in co-operation with government
instrumentalities would in this country be given the stamp of legal charity”. 
In making this statement, Helsham J. relied (as Iacobucci J. notes)
upon Verge v. Somerville, supra, where the resettlement of
demobilized members of the armed forces who had returned home from abroad — or
more specifically, “restoring them to their native land and there giving them a
fresh start in life” — was upheld as charitable.  That case concerned citizens
in the armed forces, but an obvious analogy may be made with immigrants.  In
each case, individuals need assistance in integrating into national life.  Iacobucci J.
draws a much narrower interpretation of the holding in Stone than the
passage just cited would warrant.  He does not accept that the passage applies
to immigration in general because there is no religious dimension to
immigration in general, nor are immigrants returning to their native country. 
I am not convinced that Stone can be distinguished on this basis. 
Certainly, Helsham J. did not predicate his decision to uphold the trust
at issue in Stone upon any of three narrow considerations invoked by
Iacobucci J. 86                              
In Verge v. Somerville, the Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council did not predicate its decision upon the unique hardships endured by
soldiers.  In any event, Iacobucci J.’s suggestion ignores the reality that
many immigrants have themselves suffered serious hardship.  Let me pursue the
analogy between returned soldiers and immigrants directly. Soldiers return home
after a lengthy period of time spent abroad.  They may require assistance in integrating
back into national life: employment and training opportunities, counselling,
support groups, and the like. The same is true with many immigrants.  In fact,
soldiers may have an easier time of it, as they are unlikely to face language
or cultural barriers, and are also likely to have friends and family already in
Canada to assist them in the task of reintegration.  Nonetheless, the life that
the soldier left behind before going abroad may well be gone forever, and he or
she may require assistance to making the transition to a new life upon his or
her return.  87                              
Similarly, the relief and assistance of refugees was recognized as a
charitable purpose in In re Cohen, [1954] N.Z.L.R. 1097 (S.C.), where a
bequest to a society whose principal objects were to assist Jewish refugees to
establish themselves in New Zealand was upheld under both the first and fourth
heads of the Pemsel classification.  Again, in Re Morrison
(1967), 111 Sol. Jo. 758, 117 New L.J. 757 (Ch. D.), the assistance of
refugees was recognized as a charitable purpose.  Obviously, not all immigrants
are refugees, but the two groups often share the same needs.  Distinctions may,
of course, be drawn between immigrants and refugees.  The process of analogical
reasoning, however, requires us to focus upon whether there are any relevant
differences between the two.  I can see none that are germane to the present
discussion.  88                              
In Cohen, Hay J. expressly acknowledged that although no previous
case had determined that assistance to refugees was recognized as a charitable
purpose, an analogy could be made with the demobilized soldiers under
consideration in Verge v. Somerville.  Hay J. appears to have premised
his analogy upon the proposition that both refugees and soldiers are uprooted
and are in need of being settled.  This is also an apt description of the
circumstances of many immigrants, who may have come to Canada to leave economic
and social deprivation behind them.  In any case, the reason that an individual
has left his or her home to come to Canada may have little to do with the
difficulties that the individual faces here.  Some refugees, and some
immigrants, may have little difficulty integrating into the job market.  But
many immigrants and refugees do not find the transition to their new home to be
a seamless one.  They may need assistance to meet the challenges of an
unfamiliar society.  89                              
Canadian authority recognizes assisting immigrants to obtain employment
as a charitable purpose.  In Re Fitzgibbon (1916), 27 O.W.R. 207 (H.C.),
a bequest to an organization known as the “Women’s Welcome Hostel” was upheld. 
The bequest created an annual prize to be given to a girl who had spent time at
the hostel, which was an institution for the assistance of immigrant girls, and
who had subsequently joined and remained with a single employer for three years
or more.  Middleton J. observed at p. 210 that “[t]his institution is
undoubtedly a charitable institution, for the laudable purpose of aiding and
assisting emigrant girls coming to Canada with a view of obtaining
employment”.  Because the object of the bequest was to further the aims of the
institution, which was itself charitable, it was upheld.  I might add that no
suggestion was made in the case that this purpose fit under the relief of poverty
head of the Pemsel classification, and I do not read the decision as not
following the Pemsel approach.  Middleton J. did rely on Re
Mariette, [1915] 2 Ch. 284, which admittedly had an educational dimension. 
However, the charitable status of the hostel was not directly at issue in Fitzgibbon. 
Mariette was cited only in support of the proposition that a gift to a
charitable institution is itself a charitable gift, even if the gift might not
be valid if given to a non-charitable organization.  It is uncontroversial that
the institution at issue in Fitzgibbon had an educational element, very
much like Society under consideration in this appeal, but that does not refute
Middleton J.’s characterization of the institution’s purpose.  90                              
Directly on point, the Internal Revenue Service in the United States has
ruled (U.S. Rev. Rul. 76-205 in Internal Revenue Cumulative Bulletin 1976-1, at
p. 154) that a non-profit organization whose objects are to assist
immigrants to that country “in overcoming social, cultural and economic
problems by either personal counseling or referral to the appropriate public or
private agencies” is charitable under the applicable section
(s. 501(c)(3)) of the Internal Revenue Code.  The ruling held that:  The organization was formed to aid immigrants to
the United States in overcoming social, cultural, and economic problems by
either personal counseling or referral to the appropriate public or private
agencies.  The organization has found that immigrants may be subject to
discrimination and prejudice, often arrive without friends or relatives,
possess a limited knowledge of English, and lack an awareness of employment
opportunities.  To help overcome these handicaps, the organization offers instruction
in English by its multilingual staff, job counseling, and social and
recreational functions that permit a mingling of immigrants with each other and
with United States citizens. . . .                                                                     .
. .  By counseling immigrants, the organization is
instructing the public on subjects useful to the individual and beneficial to
the community, and is, therefore, furthering an educational purpose.  Personal
counseling has been recognized as a valid method of instruction for educational
organizations.... In addition, by offering instruction in English, by assisting
immigrants in finding helpful agencies, by aiding immigrants to attain full
citizenship, and by providing opportunities for immigrants to meet and discuss
problems with each other and United States citizens, the organization is also
eliminating prejudice and discrimination.  [Citation omitted.]  91                              
The organization was upheld as pursuing a mixture of purposes, some of
which were grounded in the advancement of education head, and some of which
were grounded in the elimination of discrimination and prejudice.  Yet it
cannot be denied that the purpose of the organization itself was to aid
immigrants in integrating into national life, and it is that purpose to which I
draw the analogy here.  I fully agree that not all of the difficulties faced by
immigrant women in obtaining employment stem from prejudice and discrimination:
but it is undoubted that some of them do.  Indeed, the greatest barrier to the
integration of immigrant and visible minority women into the workforce is
probably not racial or other animus: rather, it is the unintended exclusionary
effects of facially neutral practices.  My colleague recognizes that “making
contacts and obtaining information pose difficulties with respect to gaining
employment” (para. 187).  Such difficulties, and others, are inherent in
moving to a new country.  That is why assisting immigrants in overcoming those
particular difficulties is charitable.  92                              
Likewise, the Charity Commissioners for England and Wales have
registered an organization (Ethnic Minority Training and Employment Project,
Reg. No. 1050917, registered November 22, 1995) whose objects are  to assist refugees, asylum seekers, migrants and others who recently
arrived in the United Kingdom, in particular those from the Horn of Africa, who
through their social and economic circumstances are in need and unable to
further their education or gain employment, and who may be at risk or [sic] 
permanent exclusion from the labour market; to educate and train such refugees,
asylum seekers, migrants and others by providing information, guidance,
learning opportunities, and work experience which will enable them to acquire
and develop vocational skills and secure employment, or further their
education.  93                              
My colleague suggests that that organization’s purpose is better
conceived as being for the relief of poverty.  I concede that there is a
certain degree of overlap: but for assistance in obtaining employment, it would
not be surprising if many immigrants fell into poverty, or remained there, as
the case may be.  However, I see no reason why assisting immigrant women to
obtain employment could be considered a charitable purpose only to extent that
it relieves poverty.  Poverty, as my colleague rightly suggests, is a relative
term.  In any case, the suggestion that a charitable purpose must be related to
the relief of poverty was rejected in Pemsel.  The reality is that
immigrants may face a number of obstacles to their integration into Canadian
society, social, vocational, cultural, linguistic, or economic.  It would be
futile to focus on one obstacle to the exclusion of the others.  Like the
English organization, the Society provides assistance, guidance, and learning
opportunities.  It assists immigrants in developing and acquiring vocational
skills, so that they may obtain employment.  94                              
My colleague argues that none of the cases I discuss above support my
finding that assisting immigrant women to integrate into Canadian society by
helping them to obtain employment is a charitable purpose under the fourth head
of the Pemsel classification and rejects the suggestion that that
purpose is charitable and may  be analogized to other recognized charitable
purposes.  In each case, he either denies its authority or would interpret it
very narrowly.  My colleague implicitly suggests that the approach I adopt to
the evolution of the law of charity represents “a fundamental turning in
direction” (para. 179).  I respectfully disagree.  My approach, as I have endeavoured
to demonstrate, is rooted in the existing jurisprudence.  It is consonant with
the broader principles I have set out, and indeed, with the analogical approach
which I share with my colleague, “with an eye to society’s current social,
moral, and economic context” (para. 159).  95                              
The unifying theme to these cases, in my view, is the recognition that
immigrants are often in special need of assistance in their efforts to
integrate into their new home.  Lack of familiarity with the social customs,
language, economy, job market, educational system, and other aspects of daily
life that existing inhabitants of Canada take for granted may seriously impede
the ability of immigrants to this country to make a full contribution to our
national life.  In addition, immigrants may face discriminatory practices which
too often flow from ethnic, language, and cultural differences.  An
organization, such as the Society, which assists immigrants through this
difficult transition is directed, in my view, towards a charitable purpose. 
Clearly, a direct benefit redounds to the individuals receiving assistance from
the Society.  Yet the nation as a whole gains from the integration of those
individuals into its fabric.  That is the public benefit at issue here.  I have
no hesitation in concluding that the Society’s purpose is charitable under the
second or fourth heads of the Pemsel classification.  96                              
Accordingly, in my view, this appeal does not require us to consider the
applicability of the Native Communications Society case.  The
present appeal may be disposed of without having to determine whether or not
immigrant women are in any way analogous to native people, because the
Society’s purpose fits within a recognized subcategory of the fourth head of
the Pemsel classification.  97                              
Immigrants make up a broad class of people.  Some immigrants, my
colleague suggests, will have gained admission to this country on the basis of
their education, experience, training, and skills.  Their applications for
entry will have been evaluated, in large measure, on the basis of their
perceived ability to integrate into Canadian society.  Presumably, immigrants
in this category will have little or no need of assistance in integration into
Canadian society.  Given the existence of this category of immigrants, my
colleague states that an organization that provides assistance to immigrants in
general could not be exclusively charitable.  With respect, I disagree. 
Reduced to its essentials, the contention is that an organization which seeks
to assist a class of people cannot be charitable where some members of that
class do not require the assistance that the organization seeks to provide. 
With respect, the proposition is unsustainable.  Few charities could meet such
a stringent test.  Some immigrants will have no need for the Society’s
services: some immigrants will have need of some of the Society’s services, but
not others.  Yet that recognition provides no basis upon which to argue that
the Society is not charitable.  Those who have no need of the Society’s
services will presumably not seek them out.  F.  Are the
Society’s Activities Sufficiently Related to, and in Furtherance of, its 
Purpose?  98                              
Having established that the Society’s purpose is charitable under either
the second or the fourth head of the Pemsel classification, we must next
consider whether the Society’s activities are sufficiently connected to its
purpose so as to be in furtherance of it.  There is no magic to this process: 
it is a simple matter of logical reasoning combined with an appreciation of
context.  99                              
My colleague objects (at para. 205) to several of the Society’s
activities, including its job skills directory; networking; liaising for
accreditation of foreign credentials; soliciting job opportunities; and
offering referral services.  He simply asserts that these activities “cannot be
said to be carried on in furtherance of, or incidental or ancillary to, any
valid charitable purpose”.  With respect, surely this begs the question.  It
may be that some of these activities are not sufficiently connected to the
“advancement of education”, but I need not take a position on that question in
light of my finding that assisting immigrants so that they may obtain employment
or self-employment, and thus become fully integrated into national life, is a
valid charitable purpose under the fourth head of the Pemsel
classification.  I do not see how these activities can be viewed as other than
directly connected to achieving that purpose.  100                          
I find it entirely unremarkable that an organization seeking to assist
immigrant women in obtaining employment would produce a job skills directory or
solicit employment opportunities for them.  The counselling provided by the
Society assists immigrant women in learning the social conventions and
practical realities of a job interview, résumé preparation, applying for
employment, and the like.  Some of the women who immigrate to Canada already
possess academic degrees, professional credentials, or vocational
certification.  Many of these women experience considerable difficulty in
having those credentials recognized or accepted in Canada.  The Society’s role,
as I understand it, is twofold.  First, it assists the women themselves in
building on their existing qualifications to obtain recognition or
certification in Canada, and where necessary, provides them with information on
how to upgrade their qualifications.  Second, the Society meets with and
conducts workshops for Canadian certification bodies, such as teaching and
nursing associations, in an attempt to facilitate the efforts of the women the
Society serves, and to dispel ignorance surrounding foreign accreditation. 
Finally, the Society refers immigrant women to ESL classes, and advises
Employment and Immigration Canada where there is a need for such classes.  101                          
Each of these activities is directly related to the Society’s charitable
purpose, and thus, in my judgment, each of them constitutes a “charitable
activity” under the ITA .  I am not persuaded by my colleague’s rigid
distinction between “teaching women skills they require to obtain employment in
Canada” (in his view, charitable) and “publishing a directory and otherwise
marketing those skills to prospective employers” (in his view, non-charitable)
(para. 205).  Why does publishing a job skills directory, and attempting
to make prospective employers aware of the skills possessed by its
beneficiaries, not directly further the Society’s goal of assisting immigrant
women to obtain employment?  I should have thought that these activities are
directly related to, and in furtherance of, the Society’s purpose.  Surely, a
proper determination of whether the Society’s activities are sufficiently
connected to its purpose must take into account the unique needs and problems
faced by immigrant and visible minority women in obtaining employment.  Whether
or not such activities would further a charitable purpose in the case of a
different group of beneficiaries is a distinct question which need not detain
us here.  Activities must be evaluated in the light of the purposes they are
supposed to further.  When this is done on the facts of this appeal, there is
no doubt in my mind that the Society’s activities are charitable. 
Consequently, I do not share Iacobucci J.’s view that the Society’s
activities do not further its purpose.  G.  Has the
Society Impermissibly Limited its Class of Beneficiaries?  102                          
Clause 2(a) of the Society’s constitution designates “immigrant
women” as the beneficiaries of its purpose and activities.  Revenue Canada
argued in written (though not in oral) argument that the Society’s activities
do not benefit a “sufficient section of the public” to satisfy the public
benefit requirement of the fourth head of the Pemsel classification. 
Revenue Canada concedes that “a restriction in the class of beneficiaries will
not prevent a group from obtaining charitable status where the charitable
objects and activities are interdependent with the class of beneficiaries”, but
contends that the Society does not meet this requirement of interdependence.  103                          
It is well established under the fourth head of the Pemsel
classification that to qualify as charitable, the class of persons eligible to
benefit must be the community as a whole, or an appreciably important class of
the community.  The House of Lords indicated in Baddeley, supra,
at p. 592, that a purpose falling under the fourth head could not limit
its beneficiaries by reference to creed.  Revenue Canada raised the spectre
that the Society has impermissibly limited the scope of its class of
beneficiaries.  Like my colleague, I find this argument unconvincing.  The
focus of the Society’s efforts is, admittedly, the assistance of visible
minority and immigrant women in the Vancouver area.  Indeed, as I held above,
it is the Society’s focus on immigrant women which renders its purpose
charitable.  One must not, as Lord Somervell of Harrow cautioned in Baddeley,
supra, at p. 615, consider the class apart from the particular
nature of the charitable purpose.  Without deciding that “interdependence” is
actually a legal requirement, it is easily satisfied on the facts of this
appeal.   H.  Is the Society’s Purpose Too Political to Be Charitable?  105                          
Among Revenue Canada’s grounds for refusing to register the Society as a
charitable organization under the ITA  was its view that the Society’s
purpose was political in nature.  Revenue Canada contended in its letter
refusing registration to the Society that object 2(b) of the Society was
“not acceptable” and explained that “this is a political purpose and an
organization created for political purposes, whether in whole or in part,
cannot be charitable”.  In my view, this objection is not germane to the
present appeal.  It is evident to me, as to my colleague, that the Society’s
purpose is not political.  I would, however, address the issue in a slightly
different fashion than my colleague has done.  106                          
Object 2(b) of the Society’s constitution provides that one of the
Society’s purposes is  to carry on political activities provided such activities are
incidental and ancillary to the above purposes and provided such activities do
not include direct or indirect support of, or opposition to, any political
party or candidate for public office;  The Society
contends that any political purposes or activities it may have or engage in are
purely ancillary and incidental to its main objects, as required by
s. 149.1(6.2)  of the ITA .  Indeed, the extract from the Society’s
constitution just cited closely traces the language of that subsection of the ITA :  (6.2)  For the purposes of the definition
“charitable organization” in subsection (1), where an organization devotes
substantially all of its resources to charitable activities carried on by it
and  (a) it devotes part of its resources to political activities,  (b) those political activities are ancillary and incidental to
its charitable activities, and  (c) those political activities do not include the direct or
indirect support of, or opposition to, any political party or candidate for
public office,  the organization shall be considered to be devoting that part of its
resources to charitable activities carried on by it.   108                          
In the present appeal, neither Revenue Canada nor the Society made the
distinction between purposes and activities entirely clear.  The Society’s
constitution describes the pursuit of political activities as a “purpose” of
the Society.  Revenue Canada takes a similar line, by contending that engaging
in political activities is a purpose of the Society.  However, there is simply
no evidence that the proposed political activities of the Society are anything
other than “ancillary and incidental” to its purpose, which, as I have stated,
are charitable.  It is obvious from a plain reading of purpose 2(b) that
the Society does not intend to pursue political purposes:  its intention in
drafting that paragraph was merely to authorize itself to engage in permissible
political activities.  That, in my view, is exactly the legal effect it has
achieved.  That said, clause 2(b) does not authorize the Society to pursue
political purposes, but merely enables it to engage in political activities
in furtherance of its charitable purpose, provided that such political
activities are incidental and ancillary to that charitable purpose.  In my
view, that does not lead the Society to run afoul of the ITA  or the
political purposes doctrine.   I.  Is the
Society’s Purpose Too Vague or Uncertain to Be Charitable?  110                          
One of Revenue Canada’s grounds for refusing to register the Society, a
ground subsequently upheld by the Federal Court of Appeal, was that the
Society’s purpose was too vague or uncertain to qualify as charitable in law. 
My colleague Iacobucci J. takes the same view, and ultimately decides the
present appeal on a particular application of this ground.  I cannot agree.    113                          
Vagueness and uncertainty are, to a certain degree, in the eye of the
beholder.  Nonetheless, some objective criteria may be identified.  Useful in
this regard is a comparison with D’Aguiar, supra, a leading
decision of the Privy Council on appeal from Guyana.  At issue was the tax
status of a payment made to an organization known as “The Citizens’ Advice and
Aid Service”.  The Service’s purposes were extremely broad, as is clear from
its constitution:  2.  The aims, functions and objects of the Service are:  (a)  To provide advice, aid and services on or relating to
medical, dental, optical, health, legal, matrimonial, domestic or other social
matters;  (b)  To establish and operate a fund for the assistance of those
in need on such terms and conditions as the Central Committee may determine;  (c)  To encourage thrift and provide savings facilities; (d)  To make available to the individual in confidence accurate
information and skilled advice on personal problems of daily life;  (e)  To establish, organize, sponsor or otherwise promote adult
education, and technical training of every kind including the explanation of
legislation and Government notices and publications;  (f)  To help the citizen to benefit from and to use wisely the
services provided for him by the State;  (g)  In general to advise the citizen in the many complexities
which may beset him; and  (h)  Generally to do anything to assist the citizen, whether
financial or otherwise who makes inquiry of the Service and in any way as may
be determined by the Central Committee.  3.  The Service shall be independent and free from any political or
other bias.  It shall endeavour to give advice, instruction and aid to any
member of the community who seeks, or applies for it.  114                          
Lord Wilberforce observed that the Service possessed no single dominant
purpose which could be classified as charitable in law, and to which the other
objects could be viewed as subsidiary or ancillary.  He also held, at
p. 33, that the overall object of the Service, the provision of advice to
citizens, was “too indefinite and vague to support a finding of charitable
purpose”.  However, as the purposes set out in paragraphs (a), (d)
and (g) of clause 2 of the Service’s constitution were not
charitable, the appeal was dismissed on the ground that the Service’s purposes
were not exclusively charitable.  115                          
I consider D’Aguiar to be easily distinguishable from the facts
of the present appeal.  In D’Aguiar, paragraphs (a), (d)
and (g) of clause 2 outline purposes that are phrased so
broadly that they could encompass almost anything.  No such problem bedevils
the purpose of the Society in the present appeal.  As I understand it,
Iacobucci J.’s position (though he might not phrase it this way himself)
is that although the Society’s purpose is charitable, the Society’s activities
are too vague.  Thus, as I see it, the fundamental objection raised by
Iacobucci J. is not that the Society’s purpose is vague, but rather
that it is unclear how its activities relate to its purpose.  That is a
very different objection than that which rendered the organization at issue in D’Aguiar
non-charitable.  Critically, D’Aguiar says nothing whatsoever about the
vagueness (or put another way, the lack of “connectedness”) of activities.   117                          
That said, I am not persuaded that the argument can succeed even on its
merits.  To see why, it is useful to reproduce clause 2(e) in full:  e.    To provide services and to do all such
things that are incidental or conducive to the attainment of the above stated
objects, including the seeking of funds from governments and/or other sources
for the implementation of the aforementioned objectives.  118                          
The plain language of the clause indicates the obvious intent of the
drafter to enable the Society to carry out certain activities in furtherance of
its purpose.  The clause merely provides, as the Society argues, a mechanism by
which the Society’s main purpose may be achieved.  It is self-evident that,
despite the status of clause 2(e) as a “purpose” clause, to engage in the
activities set out in clause 2(e) is not to pursue an end or purpose in
itself.  Clause 2(e) merely specifies a means “to the attainment of the
above stated objects”.  My colleague takes the position that “incidental” and
“conducive” have very different meanings, and that while the former implies a
subordinate relationship (“having a minor role in relation to”), the latter
does not (“contributing or helping [towards]”)  (Concise Oxford Dictionary
(9th ed. 1995), at pp. 686 and 278).  Thus, my colleague argues, at
para. 193, that “while doing things that are “incidental” to the
attainment of charitable purposes might safely be treated as a means of
fulfilment of the purposes, the same cannot be said of doing things that are
merely “conducive” to those ends”.  On this view, an activity might be
conducive to the Society’s main purpose without necessarily being incidental to
it.  119                          
Although I acknowledge the distinction drawn by my colleague, I do not
view it as a meaningful one on the facts of the present appeal.  First, the
argument simply assumes that the “or” is disjunctive rather than conjunctive. 
This Court demonstrated the futility of such an argument the last time it heard
an appeal on the law of charity.  In Jones v. T. Eaton Co., supra,
at p. 641, it was contended that the words “or deserving” in the phrase
“needy or deserving” were “so broad and indefinite that they deprive the
bequest of its charitable characteristic”.  The argument did not fare well. 
The Court interpreted the word “deserving” in its proper context.  The result
was that the trust at issue was held to be charitable, even if the word
“deserving” might, interpreted abstractly, be amenable to an alternative gloss.  120                          
Second, my colleague’s argument is answered by this Court’s decision in Guaranty
Trust, supra.  In that case, one of the purposes of the association
at issue, as set out in its Letters Patent, was (at p. 141):  (g) To do all such other things as are incidental or conducive
to the attainment of the above objects.  [Emphasis added.]  This language
is identical to (and if anything, the full clause itself is broader than) the
language contained in clause 2(e) in the present appeal.  Yet the phrase
“incidental or conducive” did not arouse the attention of either
Ritchie J., writing for the majority, or Cartwright J. in dissent,
nor indeed, of the Exchequer Court below ([1965] 2 Ex. C.R. 69).  One can
only speculate as to the reason for the Court’s silence, but I am left to
conclude that this Court did not address that language in Guaranty Trust
for the simple reason that the Court considered it to raise no concerns.  121                          
Again, though notionally a purpose clause, it must be recalled that what
is contemplated by clause 2(e) is the ability to conduct activities,
not purposes.  As I indicated above, the precise boundary between an
activity and a purpose is rather protean, and so one should not expect a bright
line to separate them.  The key observation is that an organization whose
purpose is charitable does not surrender that status merely because it engages
in some activities which are not in themselves charitable, so long as those
activities are subordinate to, and in furtherance of, the exclusively
charitable purpose of the organization.  That is the case here.  Accordingly, I
am not persuaded by my colleague’s argument to the contrary.  J.  Should the Common Law Definition of Charity Be Revised?  122                          
The Society and the interveners invited this Court to modify the
existing categorization of charitable purposes set out in Pemsel in
favour of a broader test.  Given my view that the existing Pemsel
classification scheme is sufficiently flexible to comprehend the Society’s
claim, and my view that the Society’s purpose is charitable within that
framework, we need not engage in such an exercise on the facts of this appeal. 
This is not to suggest that the courts are precluded from recognizing new
charitable purposes, or indeed, from revisiting the Pemsel
classification itself should an appropriate case come before us.  The task of
modernizing the definition of charity has always fallen to the courts.  There
is no indication that Parliament has expressed dissatisfaction with this state
of affairs, and it is plain that had Parliament wanted to develop a statutory
definition of charity, it could have done so.  It has not.  This leads me to
the conclusion that Parliament continues to favour judicial development of the
law of charity.  Nevertheless, on the facts of the present appeal, no wholesale
revision of the law of charity is required.  123                          
For similar reasons, we need not take a position on the argument
advanced by the Society in the Federal Court of Appeal, and by one of the
interveners before this Court, that on the facts of this appeal, s. 15  of
the Charter  has been infringed, or that the ITA  and the common
law should be interpreted in accordance with the Charter .  That the Charter 
is the repository of fundamental values which should be taken into account in
the development of the common law is undoubted:  Hill v. Church of
Scientology of Toronto, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1130, at p. 1169.  However,
given the grounds on which I would dispose of this appeal, I need not address
the possible application of that principle here.  124                          
My colleague calls for legislative intervention in the law of charity to
rectify certain deficiencies (para. 203).  I acknowledge those deficiencies,
and I agree that legislative intervention on a principled basis, leaving
adequate flexibility in the application of the law to respond to changing
social needs, would be desirable, particularly in light of a restrictive
interpretation of the common law.  125                          
My colleague’s position, ultimately, is that the Society’s appeal fails
because its purposes or activities are too vague, or else its activities are
insufficiently related to its purposes.  Iacobucci J.’s first objection, I
emphasize, would not be affected by the expansion of the existing Pemsel
categories.  As my own reasons indicate, I am not persuaded that Revenue
Canada’s concerns as to the alleged vagueness of the Society’s purpose or the
“unconnectedness” of its activities are well grounded.  I find that the
Society’s purpose is charitable under both the second and fourth heads of the Pemsel
scheme.  I am satisfied that the Society’s activities bear a coherent
relationship to, and further, its purpose, which is itself charitable. 
Iacobucci J.’s second objection stems from his refusal to recognize
assisting immigrant women to obtain employment as a charitable purpose under
the fourth head.  Adopting a new approach to the Pemsel scheme might
well render this purpose charitable.  In my view, however, no such expansion is
necessary, because that purpose is already recognized as charitable under the
fourth head.  Accordingly, Revenue Canada had no basis upon which to refuse to
register the Society as a charitable organization, and the Federal Court of
Appeal erred in not so finding.  V. Conclusion  126                          
For all of the above reasons, I would allow the appeal, with costs.  The judgment of Cory, Iacobucci, Major and Bastarache JJ. was delivered
by  Iacobucci J. -- I.  Introduction  127                          
Considering that the law of charity in Canada continues to make
reference to an English statute enacted almost 400 years ago, I find it not
surprising that there have been numerous calls for its reform, both legislative
and  judicial.  This appeal presents an opportunity to reconsider the matter. 
Not only is this Court invited to consider, for the first time in more than 25
years, the application of the law as it presently exists, but we also face the
interesting questions of whether the time for modernization has come, and if
so, what form that modernization might take.  The answers to these questions
will decide the ultimate issue before us: whether the appellant qualifies for
registration as a charitable organization under the Income Tax Act,
R.S.C., 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp .) (formerly R.S.C. 1952, c. 148).   II.  Background  128                          
Division H of Part I of the Income Tax Act  (“ITA ”)
describes persons who are exempt from tax under Part I.  Included in this
category are, among others, both registered charities and non-profit
organizations, each as defined by the ITA  (s. 149(1) (f) and (l),
respectively).  However, a registered charity is in a more advantageous tax
position even than most other persons listed in Division H: in addition to the
organization being exempt from tax, contributors to the charity are eligible to
receive tax credits in respect of the contributions made.  Simple non-profit
organizations do not enjoy this additional benefit, which is designed to
encourage the funding of activities which are generally regarded as being of
special benefit to society.  That is, the ability of a charitable organization
to carry out activities in pursuit of its goals often depends on its ability to
attract donations from the public, meaning that the capacity to offer tax
benefits to prospective donors can be a major determinant of the success of
such an organization.  129                          
       Against this legal background, it is not surprising that the appellant,
the Vancouver Society of Immigrant and Visible Minority Women (the “Society”)
has a strong interest in becoming a registered charity.  On May 10, 1993, the
Society applied to the Minister of National Revenue (the “Minister”) for this
designation, as required by s. 248(1)  of the ITA .  A previous
application had been denied in 1992, and the Society had amended its
constitution in an attempt to conform to the requirements of the ITA . 
Thus, at the time of the second application, the Society’s stated purposes were
as follows:  2.    (a)     To educate members of the Community
at large, including immigrant & visible minority women, on the needs and
concerns of immigrant & visible minority women in Canada;  (b)     To foster and promote social awareness and
community involvement in civic education, volunteer and membership development
and preventive social services;  (c)     To facilitate immigrant and visible
minority women in achieving economic and social independence and their full
potential in Canadian society;  (d)     To co-operate and build a network within
British Columbia, especially among immigrant and visible minority women and
concerned individuals and groups, in order to provide current information and
services for the purpose of mutual support;  (e)     To provide services and to do all such
things that are incidental or conducive to the attainment of the above stated
objects, including the seeking of funds from governments and/or other sources
for the implementation of the aforementioned objectives.   130                          
In further support of its application, and as required by Revenue
Canada, the Society submitted a Statement of Activities which described its
objects as “non-political and charitable”, and its activities as providing a
“public benefit” through services and workshops “designed to ‘relieve poverty’
and to ‘advance education’”. Among such services were “career and vocational
counselling ... where we provide information and assistance in resume writing,
interview skills, and dealing with Canadian employers”.  Also mentioned was an
“anti-racism education workshop ... educating the general public, particularly
to teachers and students, about this important issue”.  131                          
In a follow-up telephone call with Revenue Canada on August 24, 1993, an
officer of the Society detailed other activities of the organization. Revenue
Canada’s memorandum detailing this conversation listed the following:  1. Membership  About 300 members from all walks of life seeking
employment opportunities and general support for integration into Canadian
life.  2. Job Skills Directory  In addition to its own membership, others wishing
to be included in the directory are listed, for a total of approx. 600 persons,
ranging from those on social assistance to professionals who have been in the
country for a few years and wish to re-enter the work force. No percentages
available re income level of those listed.  The Society does not arrange interviews for persons
listed. Organizations wishing to employ persons send notice to the Society of
jobs that are available. While this information may be brought to the attention
of individuals with the required skills, it is up to the person to make the
contact and seek the job.  The Directory is not circulated in the job market,
but its existence is advertised by the Society in EIC, in educational
institutions, etc.  3. Job Skills Training  Other than placing volunteer workers as
receptionists, clerks, bookkeepers, computer operators, etc. within the
Society’s operation, no training in various skills is undertaken by the
Society.  However, pre-Employment counselling re resumes,
conduct of job interviews, where to apply for jobs, etc. is conducted by the
Society.    4. Employment Equity and Foreign Credentials Committees  Both are concerned with the matter of recognition
of degrees and certifications earned in other countries which are not accepted
in Canada. Workshops and meetings with teaching and nursing associations and
institutions are held to discuss accreditation of certifications and informing
individuals of courses required to bring their qualifications to Canadian
standards.  This is strictly an educational process -- doesn’t
involve legislation.  5. ESL Classes -- are conducted by Employment & Immigration
Canada. The Society refers its people to EIC and advises EIC when a need for
the class arises.  6. Support Group for Professionals  Assistance and encouragement is given by
professional committee to professional members wishing to enter or re-enter the
work force, most often with regard to upgrading their certification to meet
Canadian requirements.                                                                     .
. .  I questioned “preventive social services”. She explained such
activities as public workshop [sic], meetings on matters like abuse,
violence vs. women, anti-racism.   132                          
In a letter dated August 27, 1993, Revenue Canada raised a number of
concerns with respect to the Society’s application and indicated that the
Society “as presently constituted [was] unlikely to qualify for registration”. 
In general, it stated that the objectives of the Society were too broadly and
vaguely worded to be acceptable as charitable purposes, and failed “to specify
the charitable means of addressing the particular needs and concerns” of
immigrant and visible minority women.  It also indicated that the terms “to
foster”, “to promote”, and “to facilitate”, as contained in the purposes
clause, were generally considered too remote from the actual conduct of a
charitable program to constitute actual charitable activity.  133                          
In response, on December 3, 1993, the Society proposed to amend its
purposes clause again in order to conform to the required standards.  The
proposed clause described the Society’s purposes as follows:  2. ...  a.    to provide educational forums, classes,
workshops and seminars to immigrant women in order that they may be able to
find or obtain employment or self employment;  b.    to carry on political activities provided
such activities are incidental and ancillary to the above purposes and provided
such activities do not include direct or indirect support of, or opposition to,
any political party or candidate for public office; and  c.    to raise funds in order to carry out the
above purposes by means of solicitations of funds from governments,
corporations and individuals.   134                          
However, Revenue Canada indicated by letter dated January 25, 1994, that
the Society was still unlikely to qualify.  It explained that the “educational”
purpose described in paragraph (a) “lacks the element of well-rounded,
systematic instruction that characterizes education in the charitable sense”,
given that the presentation of selected items of information orally or in
writing to the public did not, in its view, satisfy the requirements of an
educational charity: the training of the mind through the learning of a
vocational skill or improvement upon a useful branch of human knowledge. 
Revenue Canada was of the view that the “educational” activities conducted by
the Society were primarily information sessions which, although informative and
helpful to interested persons, were not carried out in the systematic and
structured manner required. Further, paragraphs (b) and (c) did not disclose
charitable purposes, and as such could only be acceptable if considered to be
ancillary and incidental activities carried on in furtherance of a primary
charitable purpose.  135                          
Notwithstanding this negative feedback, the Society formally changed its
purposes clause on May 10, 1994.  The amended clause incorporated paragraphs
(a), (b), and (c) as set out in the December 3 letter, deleted the former
paragraph (d) and retained paragraph (e). The Society advised Revenue Canada of
this change on May 20.  In further support of its position, it also provided a
variety of other material, including a paper entitled “A Study of Immigrant
Women in Vancouver”, which purported to examine the plight of immigrant women
in society as a whole and identified specific difficulties encountered by them
in seeking employment in Canada.  A letter from another officer of the Society
was also sent, stressing that the Society “does not engage in any partisan
political activity ... [and] spends its ‘advocacy’ energies and dollars in
assisting women in employment related activity -- specifically giving
information on community services, teaching job search techniques, assisting
with resume writing, etc.”.  136                          
By letter dated October 14, 1994, Revenue Canada formally rejected the
Society’s application.  It expressed that it was not convinced that the
organization was constituted exclusively for charitable purposes, as required
for registration under the ITA , as it did not devote substantially all
its resources to charitable activities.  It rejected the Society’s attempt to
draw an analogy between immigrant and visible minority women and aboriginal Canadians,
who had been given special treatment for the purposes of registration as a
charity in Native Communications Society of B.C. v. Canada (M.N.R.),
[1986] 3 F.C. 471 (C.A.), opining that the special status of aboriginals in
Canadian society was not comparable to the position of visible minority women. 
Further, it reiterated its finding that the Society’s programs and activities
were not “educational” within the meaning of that term for the purposes of
charity law, and also expressed that, to the extent that the Society was
apparently created, in whole or in part, for political purposes, it could not
be considered a charitable organization for the purposes of the ITA . 
Finally, it explained that, although some of the Society’s activities appeared
to be charitable, the Society had not established that substantially all of 
its resources were devoted to charitable activities.  On this score, Revenue
Canada cited such activities as networking, soliciting job opportunities, and
maintaining a job skills directory as non-charitable.  137                          
The Federal Court of Appeal dismissed the Society’s appeal: 96 D.T.C.
6232.  Writing for himself and Linden and Strayer JJ.A., Décary J.A. found that
the Society’s activities did not come within the well-established divisions of charity
as originally set out by Lord Macnaghten in Commissioners for Special
Purposes of the Income Tax v. Pemsel, [1891] A.C. 531 (H.L.), or the
subsequent common-law development of these categories.  He found that the
activities were consistent neither with the advancement of education nor with
benefit to the community in a way which the law regards as charitable. The
activities of the Society were “not sufficiently structured and articulated as
to respond to the requirements set out by the jurisprudence” for the
advancement of education (p. 6233).  138                          
As to public benefit, Décary J.A., like Revenue Canada, rejected the
analogy to Native Communications Society, supra, on the basis
that aboriginal people “have a distinct constitutional status quite apart from
the Charter ” (p. 6233).  Given that the appropriate question was not “who are
those who are most likely to benefit?” but, rather, “do the proposed purposes
and activities constitute charitable activities within the ambit of the law of
charities?”, Décary J.A. could not find that providing a benefit to those, like
minority women, who are in a position to invoke Charter  rights, could in
itself make charitable an activity which would not otherwise be so.  139                          
In the view of the Federal Court of Appeal, the overriding flaw in the
Society’s application was that its purposes and activities were so indefinite
and vague as to prevent the Minister from determining with any certainty what
the activities were, who their intended beneficiaries were, and whether these
beneficiaries were truly in need of charity.  In other words, the purposes and
activities were so vague as potentially to permit the Society’s resources to be
used for non-charitable purposes: D’Aguiar v. Guyana Commissioner of
Inland Revenue, [1970] T.R. 31 (P.C.).  Thus, in the view of the court, the
Society, “in being too many things to too many people has opened the door to
purposes beyond the legal definition of ‘charity’” (p. 6234).  III.  Relevant
Statutory Provisions  140                           
Income Tax Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp .)  149.     (1)  No tax is payable under this
Part on the taxable income of a person for a period when that person was  (f) a registered charity;   149.1 (1) In this section,                                                                     .
. .  “charitable foundation” means a corporation or trust that is
constituted and operated exclusively for charitable purposes, no part of the
income of which is payable to, or is otherwise available for, the personal
benefit of any proprietor, member, shareholder, trustee or settlor thereof, and
that is not a charitable organization;  “charitable organization” means an organization, whether or not
incorporated,  (a) all the resources of which are devoted to charitable
activities carried on by the organization itself,  (b) no part of the income of which is payable to, or is
otherwise available for, the personal benefit of any proprietor, member,
shareholder, trustee or settlor thereof,                                                                     .
. .  (6.1) For the purposes of the definition
“charitable foundation” in subsection (1), where a corporation or trust devotes
substantially all of its resources to charitable purposes and  (a) it devotes part of its resources to political activities,  (b) those political activities are ancillary and incidental to
its charitable purposes, and  (c) those political activities do not include the direct or
indirect support of, or opposition to, any political party or candidate for
public office,  the corporation or trust shall be considered to be constituted and
operated for charitable purposes to the extent of that part of its resources so
devoted.    (6.2) For the purposes of the definition “charitable
organization” in subsection (1), where an organization devotes substantially
all of its resources to charitable activities carried on by it and  (a) it devotes part of its resources to political activities,  (b) those political activities are ancillary and incidental to
its charitable activities, and  (c) those political activities do not include the direct or
indirect support of, or opposition to, any political party or candidate for
public office,  the organization shall be considered to be devoting that part of its
resources to charitable activities carried on by it.  248.  (1) In this Act,                                                                     .
. .  “registered charity” at any time means                     (a) a charitable
organization, private foundation or public foundation, within the meanings
assigned by subsection 149.1(1) , that is resident in Canada and was either
created or established in Canada,                                                                      ...  that has applied to the Minister in prescribed form for registration
and that is at that time registered as a charitable organization, private
foundation or public foundation;  IV.  Issues  141                       
Did the Federal Court of Appeal err in law in finding that the Society
did not qualify as a charitable organization within the meaning of the ITA ? 
Further, if the Society does not qualify under the traditional definition of
charity, should a new approach to the law of charity be adopted?  If so, what
form should it take, and can the Society qualify under the new approach?   V.  Analysis  A.  Charity
Under the Income Tax Act  and at Common Law  142                       
As I have already explained, s. 248(1)  of the ITA  empowers the
Minister to grant registered-charity status to qualified charitable
organizations and charitable foundations.  To be considered a “charitable
organization” for the purposes of the ITA , however, an organization must
come within the criteria set out in s. 149.1(1) , the most significant of which
for the purposes of this appeal is that the organization must devote all of its
resources to charitable activities.  143                       
While this may appear, at first glance, to be rather a simple test, it
actually poses a number of problems.  For one, the ITA  does not define
what is or is not a charitable activity.  Rather, it implicitly relies upon 
the common law for guidance.  As Stone J.A. put it in Positive Action
Against Pornography v. M.N.R., [1988] 2 F.C. 340 (C.A.), at p. 347:  . . . the Act appears clearly to envisage a resort to the common law
for a definition of “charity” in its legal sense as well as for the principles
that should guide us in applying that definition.   144                       
The common-law definition of “charity” developed in the context of trust
law, where a charitable purpose trust is an exception to the general rule that
a purpose trust in invalid. Therefore the trust law question focuses on
charitable purposes and not charitable activities. The starting point for the
determination of whether a purpose is charitable has, for more than a century,
been  Lord Macnaghten’s classification, set out in Pemsel, supra,
of the purposes the common law had come to recognize as charitable:  “Charity” in its legal sense comprises four principal divisions: trusts
for the relief of poverty; trusts for the advancement of education; trusts for
the advancement of religion; and trusts for other purposes beneficial to the
community, not falling under any of the preceding heads.   Subsequent
courts and commentators have held that Lord Macnaghten was adopting Lord
Romilly’s classification (as counsel) from Morice v. Bishop of Durham
(1805), 10 Ves. Jun. 522, 32 E.R. 947, at p. 951, on appeal from the decree of
the Master of the Rolls (1804), 9 Ves. Jun. 399, 32 E.R. 656, which was:  . . . 1st, relief of the indigent; in various ways: money: provisions:
education: medical assistance; &c.: 2dly, the advancement of learning:
3dly, the advancement of religion; and, 4thly, which is the most difficult, the
advancement of objects of general public utility.  This
classification is generally understood to refer to the preamble of the Charitable
Uses Act, 1601, 43 Eliz. 1, c. 4, commonly referred to as the Statute of
Elizabeth, which listed various activities thought to be charitable.  The
preamble was, as D. W. M. Waters puts it, “the judicial lodestar as to what
sort of activities (or trust purposes)” were to be considered charitable:
Law of Trusts in Canada (2nd ed. 1984), at p. 550.  145                       
The preamble lists many charitable purposes and is most commonly
referred to in its modern English rendition, as it was by Slade J. in McGovern
v. Attorney-General, [1982] Ch. 321, at p. 332, and adopted on several
occasions by the Federal Court of Appeal:  . . . the relief of aged, impotent and poor people[;] maintenance of
sick and maimed soldiers and mariners, schools of learning, free schools, and
scholars in universities[;] repair of bridges, ports, havens, causeways,
churches, seabanks and highways[;] education and preferment of orphans[;]
relief, stock or maintenance for houses of correction[;] marriages of poor
maids[;] supportation, aid and help of young tradesmen, handicraftsmen and
persons decayed[;] relief or redemption of prisoners or captives, and for aid
or ease of any poor inhabitants concerning payments of fifteens, setting out of
soldiers and other taxes.    146                       
However, it is important to recall Lord Macnaghten’s understanding of
the status of the preamble. In Pemsel, supra, at p. 581, immediately
after his observation that “charity” has a technical meaning and prior to his
outline of the four divisions, Lord Macnaghten made the following reference to
the Statute of Elizabeth:  Whatever may have been the foundation of the jurisdiction of the Court
over [charitable] trusts, and whatever may have been the origin of the title by
which these trusts are still known, no one I think who takes the trouble to
investigate the question can doubt that the title was recognised and the
jurisdiction established before the Act of 43 Eliz. and quite independently of
that Act. The object of that statute was merely to provide new machinery
for the reformation of abuses in regard to charities. But by a singular construction
it was held to authorize certain gifts to charity which otherwise would have
been void. And it contained in the preamble a list of charities so varied and
comprehensive that it became the practice of the Court to refer to it as a sort
of index or chart. At the same time it has never been forgotten that the
“objects there enumerated,” as Lord Chancellor Cranworth observes (1 D. &
J. 79), “are not to be taken as the only objects of charity but are given as
instances.”  [Emphasis added.]   Therefore the
court has always had the jurisdiction to decide what is charitable and was
never bound by the preamble. Nonetheless, the preamble proved to be a rich
source of examples and the law of charities has proceeded by way of analogy to
the purposes enumerated in the preamble.  Indeed, as Lord Wilberforce observed
in Scottish Burial Reform and Cremation Society Ltd. v. Glasgow
Corporation, [1968] A.C. 138 (H.L.), at p. 154:  ...it is now accepted that what must be regarded is not the wording of
the preamble itself, but the effect of decisions given by the courts as to its
scope, decisions which have endeavoured to keep the law as to charities moving
according as new social needs arise or old ones become obsolete or satisfied.
Lord Macnaghten’s grouping of the heads of recognised charity in Pemsel’s
case is one that has proved to be of value and there are many problems which it
solves. But three things may be said about it, which its author would surely
not have denied: first that, since it is a classification of convenience, there
may well be purposes which do not fit neatly into one or other of the headings;
secondly, that the words used must not be given the force of a statute to be
construed; and thirdly, that the law of charity is a moving subject which may well
have evolved even since 1891.  147                       
The Supreme Court of Canada implicitly adopted the Pemsel
classification in The King v. Assessors of the Town of Sunny Brae,
[1952] 2 S.C.R. 76, and explicitly  approved of it in Guaranty Trust Co. of
Canada v. Minister of National Revenue, [1967] S.C.R. 133.
However, in Guaranty Trust this Court also noted, citing with approval Verge
v. Somerville, [1924] A.C. 496 (P.C.), at p. 499,  that the Pemsel
scheme is subject to the consideration that the purpose must also be “[f]or the
benefit of the community or of an appreciably important class of the community”
(p. 141).  This language of “benefit of the community” is unfortunate because 
it creates confusion with the fourth head of charity under the Pemsel
scheme -- trusts for other purposes beneficial to the community. Nonetheless,
this other notion of public benefit is different and reflects the general
concern that “[t]he essential attribute of a charitable activity is that it
seeks the welfare of the public; it is not concerned with the conferment of
private advantage”:  Waters, supra, at p. 550. This public
character is a requirement that attaches to all the heads of charity, although 
sometimes the requirement is attenuated under the head of poverty. It is this
public quality that I also take Rand J. to be referring to in Sunny Brae,
supra, at p. 88, when, after outlining the four classifications of
charitable purposes, he stated that “the attributes attaching to all are their
voluntariness and, directly or indirectly, their reflex on public welfare”.  148                       
The difference between the Pemsel classification and this
additional notion of being “for the benefit of the community” is perhaps best
understood in the following terms. The  requirement of being “for the benefit
of the community” is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for a finding
of charity at common law. If it is not present, then the purpose cannot be
charitable. However, even if it is present  the court must still ask whether
the purpose in question has what Professor Waters calls, at p. 550,  the
“generic character” of charity. This character is discerned by perceiving an 
analogy with those purposes already found to be charitable at common law, and
which are classified for convenience in Pemsel. The difference is also
often one of focus: the four heads of charity concern what is being provided
while the “for the benefit of the community” requirement more often centers on
who is  the recipient.  149                       
Although the Pemsel approach  has been applied countless times by
Canadian courts, both prior and subsequent to Guaranty Trust, its
application to the myriad of modern organizations vying to be identified as
charitable has often proved a daunting task. There have been repeated calls for
the expansion or replacement of the test to reflect more completely the
standards and values of modern Canadian society.  As Strayer J.A. recently
observed in Human Life International in Canada Inc. v. M.N.R.,
[1998] 3 F.C. 202 (C.A.), at para. 8, the definition of charity “remains ... an
area crying out for clarification through Canadian legislation for the guidance
of taxpayers, administrators, and the courts”.  150                       
In the absence of legislative reform, Canadian courts must contend with
the difficulty of articulating how the law of charities is to keep “moving” in
a manner that is consistent with the nature of the common law. As this Court
held in R. v. Salituro, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 654, at p. 670:  Judges can and should adapt the common law to reflect the changing
social, moral and economic fabric of the country. Judges should not be quick to
perpetuate rules whose social foundation has long since disappeared.
Nonetheless, there are significant constraints on the power of the judiciary to
change the law. As McLachlin J. indicated in Watkins, supra, in a
constitutional democracy such as ours it is the legislature and not the courts
which has the major responsibility for law reform; and for any changes to the
law which may have complex ramifications, however necessary or desirable such
changes may be, they should be left to the legislature. The judiciary should
confine itself to those incremental changes which are necessary to keep the
common law in step with the dynamic and evolving fabric of our society.  There are thus
limits to the law reform that may be undertaken by the judiciary.  151                       
Furthermore, given that the present appeal concerns the definition of a
charitable organization for the purposes of the ITA , it is imperative to
preserve the distinction that the ITA  makes between charitable and
non-profit organizations. Non-profit organizations, according to s. 149(1) (l),
include  a club, society or association that, in the opinion of the Minister,
was not a charity within the meaning assigned by subsection 149.1(1)  and that
was organized and operated exclusively for social welfare, civic improvement,
pleasure or recreation or for any other purpose except profit, no part of the
income of which was payable to, or was otherwise available for the personal
benefit of, any proprietor, member or shareholder thereof unless the
proprietor, member or shareholder was a club, society or association the
primary purpose and function of which was the promotion of amateur athletics in
Canada;  Therefore
according to the ITA , it must be possible to have an organization that
is “operated exclusively for social welfare” and is not constituted for private
advantage, but which is not a charitable organization. The common law of
charities must not be  interpreted so as to undermine this distinction between
non-profit organizations and charitable organizations.  152                       
While the definition of “charitable” is one major problem with the
standard in s. 149.1(1) , it is not the only one.  Another is its focus on
“charitable activities” rather than purposes.   The difficulty is that the
character of an activity is at best ambiguous; for example, writing a letter to
solicit donations for a dance school might well be considered charitable, but
the very same activity might lose its charitable character if the donations
were to go to a group disseminating hate literature.  In other words, it is
really the purpose in furtherance of which an activity is carried out, and not
the character of the activity itself, that determines whether or not it is of a
charitable nature.  Accordingly, this Court held in Guaranty Trust, supra,
that the inquiry must focus not only on the activities of an organization but
also on its purposes.  153                       
Unfortunately, this distinction has often been blurred by judicial
opinions which have used the terms “purposes” and “activities” almost
interchangeably.  Such inadvertent confusion inevitably trickles down to the
taxpayer organization, which is left to wonder how best to represent its
intentions to Revenue Canada in order to qualify for registration.  In fact, as
may become clear shortly, the Society may have suffered exactly this difficulty
in drafting its purposes clause.  154                       
The final consideration raised by s. 149.1 is that of exclusive
charitability. Under subs. (1), the definition of  “charitable foundation”
includes the requirement that it  “is constituted and operated exclusively for
charitable purposes” and “charitable organization” means, inter alia, an
organization “all the resources of which are devoted to charitable activities
carried on by the organization itself”.  The ITA, therefore, clearly
requires that all of  the purposes and activities of the foundation or
organization be  charitable. In light of the preceding discussion regarding the
construal of charitable activities, exclusively charitable activities
would be those that directly further charitable  purposes and not other,
non-charitable, purposes.  155                       
The ITA does make an exception to this requirement of exclusive
charitability in s. 149.1(6.1)  and (6.2) . Subsection (6.1) reads as follows:  (6.1) For the purposes of the definition
“charitable foundation” in subsection (1), where a corporation or trust devotes
substantially all of its resources to charitable purposes and  (a) it devotes part of its resources to political activities,  (b) those political activities are ancillary and incidental to
its charitable purposes, and  (c) those political activities do not include the direct or
indirect support of, or opposition to, any political party or candidate for
public office, the corporation or trust shall be considered to be constituted and
operated for charitable purposes to the extent of that part of its resources so
devoted.   Subsection
(6.2) is identical except that it applies to a “charitable organization” rather
than “charitable foundation”  and refers to “charitable activities” rather than
“charitable purposes”. Thus the ITA  will accept as charitable an
organization/trust/corporation  that devotes “substantially all” rather than
all of its resources to charitable activities or purposes only when that
organization/trust/corporation meets the requirements of subss. (6.1) and (6.2)
which refer to political activities. Otherwise, an organization that
devotes substantially all of its resources, rather than all,  to charitable
activities would run afoul of the general requirement of exclusive
charitability found in the definitions of “charitable foundation” and
“charitable organization” in s. 149.1(1) .  156                       
There is, however, one other exception to this rule.  Though they
concerned a provision of an Act other than our ITA , I believe the words
of Denning L.J. in British Launderers’ Research Association v. Borough
of Hendon Rating Authority, [1949] 1 K.B. 462 (C.A.), at pp. 467-68,
as adopted by this Court in Guaranty Trust, supra, at p. 143, are
apposite in this instance as well:  It is not sufficient that the society should be instituted “mainly” or
“primarily” or “chiefly” for the purposes of science, literature or the fine
arts.  It must be instituted “exclusively” for those purposes.  The only
qualification -- which, indeed, is not really a qualification at all -- is that
other purposes which are merely incidental to the purposes of science and
literature or the fine arts, that is, merely a means to the fulfilment of
those purposes, do not deprive a society of the exemption.  Once however,
the other purposes cease to be merely incidental but become collateral; that
is, cease to be a means to an end, but become an end in themselves; that is,
become additional purposes of the society; then, whether they be main or
subsidiary, whether they exist jointly with or separately from the purposes of
science, literature or the fine arts, the society cannot claim the exemption.
[Emphasis added by Ritchie J. in Guaranty Trust.]  157                       
In Guaranty Trust, Ritchie J., for the majority, relied on this
statement to find that, although a particular purpose was not itself
charitable, it was incidental to another, charitable purpose, and was therefore
properly to be considered not as an end in itself, but as a “means of
fulfilment” of another purpose, which had already been determined to be
charitable.  Viewed in this way, it did not vitiate the charitable character of
the organization.  (See also Positive Action Against Pornography, supra,
at p. 355, where a similar argument was considered and rejected, but only on
the facts.)  158                       
The chief proposition to be drawn from this holding is that even the
pursuit of a purpose which would be non-charitable in itself may not disqualify
an organization from being considered charitable if it is pursued only as a
means of fulfilment of another, charitable, purpose and not as an end in
itself. That is, where the purpose is better construed as an activity in direct
furtherance of a charitable purpose, the organization will not fail to qualify
as charitable because it described the activity as a purpose.  159                       
In conclusion, on the basis of the Canadian jurisprudence, the
requirements for registration under s. 248(1)  come down to two:  (1)    the purposes of the organization must be
charitable, and must define the scope of  the activities engaged in by the
organization; and  (2)    all of the organization’s resources must be
devoted to these activities unless the organization falls within the specific
exemptions of s. 149.1(6.1)  or (6.2) .   In the absence
of legislative reform providing guidelines, the best way in which to discern
the charitable quality of an organization’s purposes  is to continue to proceed
by way of analogy to those purposes already found to be charitable by the
common law, and conveniently classified in Pemsel, subject always to the
general requirement of providing a benefit to the community, and with an eye to
society’s current social, moral, and economic context. The task at hand, then,
is to consider whether the Society, as presently constituted, has met these
criteria.  B.  Charitable
Purposes  160                       
The Society submits that its purposes clause restricts it to activities
which qualify as charitable either under the second heading in Pemsel,
the advancement of education, or the fourth heading, purposes beneficial to the
community.  However, for the reasons that follow, I cannot accede to this
submission.  In the end, while it is true that at least some of the Society’s
purposes contemplate charitable activities, it cannot be said that they
restrict the Society to charitable activities alone, even if this was the
intention behind the re-drafting of the clause.  (1)    Advancement of Education  161                       
In Canada, “advancement of education” has been given a fairly restricted
meaning. As noted by Stone J.A. in Positive Action Against Pornography, supra,
at pp. 348-49, it has generally been limited to the “formal training of the
mind” or the “improvement of a useful branch of human knowledge”, and even that
has been considered an expansion of the traditional view, which admitted only
of the former.  Relying upon this, Stone J.A. rejected the submission that the
distribution of “educational” material regarding the issue of pornography was a
charitable activity.  As he stated,  at p. 349, “the presentation to the public
of selected items of information and opinion ... cannot be regarded as
educational in the sense understood by this branch of the law”.  See also Interfaith
Development Education Association, Burlington v. M.N.R., 97
D.T.C. 5424 (F.C.A.), as well as Briarpatch Inc. v. The Queen,
96 D.T.C. 6294 (F.C.A.), in which Robertson J.A. relied (at p. 6295) on the
following passage from Maclean Hunter Ltd. v. Deputy Minister of
National Revenue for Customs and Excise, 88 D.T.C. 6096 (F.C.A.), as a
guide:  [W]hen the word “education” or “educational” is used without
qualification, it has reference to a fundamental process of learning which is
aimed at preparing either for life in general or for a large purpose such as a
particular profession or trade, and is in any event without an immediately
utilitarian focus.   162                       
Viewed in light of these common-law parameters, the decisions by Revenue
Canada and the Federal Court of Appeal to deny registration to the Society
under the advancement of education category are neither surprising nor
incorrect.   Although purpose (a) does contemplate the provision of
“educational forums, classes, workshops and seminars”, the goal of these
programs is clearly “immediately utilitarian”: preparing women “to find or
obtain employment or self-employment”.  This does not, in my view, equate to
preparation for “life in general” or for a “particular profession or trade”.  163                       
This conclusion is bolstered, I think, by the nature of the activities
which the Society viewed as coming within purpose (a).  On the basis of the
Society’s submissions and follow-up conversations, it was not unreasonable for
Revenue Canada to conclude that there was  no systematic instructional
structure or format to the supposedly educational activities planned by the
Society.  Indeed, quite apart from the way in which these programs ultimately
may have been implemented, it seems that the Society was unable even to show
any actual intention to confine its activities to within either the formal
training of the mind or the improvement of a useful branch of human knowledge,
as those terms have been defined at common law.  It is easy to see how
information sessions presented on such topics as human rights, employment
equity, violence and abuse against women, and how to start a small business,
while probably informative and important, would appear to be more in the nature
of “the presentation to the public of selected items of information and
opinion”, to borrow the language of Stone J.A. in Positive Action Against
Pornography, supra.  Thus, if lacking the quality of systematic
instruction must necessarily disqualify an activity from coming within the
advancement of education, then the Federal Court of Appeal was justified in
finding that the Society’s activities were not charitable under this heading,
and consequently that the purposes clause, to the extent that it contemplated
such activities, did not restrict the Society to charitable activities for the
advancement of education.  164                       
However, while the Federal Court of Appeal may have followed its own
jurisprudence, it is not clear to me that this Court should as well. I think
that Stone J.A.’s statement that “the presentation to the public of selected
items of information” is not educational must be read in light of his
conclusions with respect to the fourth head of charity, namely that the
material being disseminated exhibited a strong anti-pornography bias. Clearly
such biased material, in most cases, would disqualify an organization from the
second head of charity without necessitating an inquiry into whether the
organization pursued some kind of formal training of the mind, broadly
understood.  165                       
I do not endorse Robertson J.A.’s approval, in Briarpatch, supra,
of the definition of “education” found in Maclean Hunter, supra.  Maclean
Hunter is not a charities case, and was concerned, among other things, with
the meaning of the “printed books . . . [used] solely for educational . . .
purposes” exemption from sales tax under the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C.
1970, c. E-13, ss. 27(1), 29(1) and Sch. III, Part III, s. 3(a). The
court referred to the plain meaning of “education” to decide this question.
However, to find that a purpose falls under the second head of charity, one
proceeds by way of analogy to other cases found to fall under that head, not by
asking whether the purpose would be found to fall within the plain meaning of
“education”. In other words, the question is what is educational in the way the
law of charities uses the term.  166                       
For these reasons, I believe that the law regarding the educational head
of charity should be modified and in that respect it is worth considering the
slightly more expansive approach taken by the English courts.  Although Stone
J.A. alluded to this in Positive Action Against Pornography, the full
inclusiveness of this approach certainly did not find its way into Canadian law
by virtue either of that judgment or of its progeny.  In Inland Revenue
Commissioners v. McMullen, [1981] A.C. 1, at p. 15, the House of
Lords recognized that  both the legal conception of charity, and within it the educated man’s
ideas about education, are not static, but moving and changing.  Both change
with changes in ideas about social values.  Both have evolved with the years. 
In particular in applying the law to contemporary circumstances it is extremely
dangerous to forget that thoughts concerning the scope and width of education
differed in the past greatly from those which are now generally accepted.   See also Re
Hopkins’ Will Trusts, [1964] 3 All E.R. 46 (Ch. D.), and Scottish Burial
Reform, supra.  167                       
This judicial attitude has led, for example, to the characterization as
charitable of a trust for the support of an amateur soccer league, on the
grounds that it promoted the physical education and development of students as
an adjunct to their formal education (McMullen), as well as a trust for
the promotion of conferences on a wide variety of academic subjects: Re
Koeppler Will Trusts, [1986] Ch. 423 (C.A.).  Even in Canada, the law has
occasionally recognized non-traditional educational activities as charitable,
such as a summer camp where children were taught about their heritage and
ancestral culture: Re Societa Unita and Town of Gravenhurst
(1977), 16 O.R. (2d) 785 (H.C.), aff’d (1978), 6 M.P.L.R. 172 (Ont. Div. Ct.).  168                       
In my view, there is much to be gained by adopting a more inclusive
approach to education for the purposes of the law of charity.  Indeed, compared
to the English approach, the limited Canadian definition of education as the
“formal training of the mind” or the “improvement of a useful branch of human
knowledge” seems unduly restrictive.  There seems no logical or principled
reason why the advancement of education should not be interpreted to include more
informal training initiatives, aimed at teaching necessary life skills or
providing information toward a practical end, so long as these are truly geared
at the training of the mind and not just the promotion of a particular point of
view.  Notwithstanding the limitations posed by the existing jurisprudence, to
adopt such an approach would amount to no more than the type of incremental
change to the common law of which this Court has approved in such decisions as Watkins
v. Olafson, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 750, and Salituro, supra.  169                       
To limit the notion of “training of the mind” to structured, systematic
instruction or traditional academic subjects reflects an outmoded and under
inclusive understanding of education which is of little use in modern Canadian
society.  As I said earlier, the purpose of offering certain benefits to
charitable organizations is to promote activities which are seen as being of
special benefit to the community, or advancing a common good.  In the case of
education, the good advanced is knowledge or training.  Thus, so long as
information or training is provided in a structured manner and for a genuinely
educational purpose -- that is, to advance the knowledge or abilities of the
recipients -- and not solely to promote a particular point of view or political
orientation, it may properly be viewed as falling within the advancement of
education.  170                       
As the Ontario Law Reform Commission pointed out in its 1996 Report
on the Law of Charities, knowledge can take many forms.  It can be
theoretical or practical, speculative or technical, scientific or moral. 
Moreover, it can be sought in many different ways, and for many different
reasons, whether for its own sake or as a means to an end.  Viewed in this way,
there is no good reason why non-traditional activities such as workshops,
seminars, self-study, and the like should not be included alongside
traditional, classroom-type instruction in a modern definition of “education”. 
Similarly, there is no reason to exclude education aimed at advancing a
specific, practical end.  In terms of encouraging activities which are of
special benefit to the community, which is the ultimate policy reason for
offering tax benefits to charitable organizations, there is nothing to be
gained, and much to be lost, by arbitrarily denying benefits to organizations
devoted to advancing various types of useful knowledge.  171                       
That is not to say that education should be broadened beyond
recognition, however.  Even while advocating a more inclusive approach to
education, the Ontario Law Reform Commission also cautioned against treating as
educational those activities which, although they advance legitimate goods, do
not include any actual teaching or learning component.  The concern is that, in
certain cases, activities which fit awkwardly with the concept of education --
such as, for example, a trust to assist the publication of unknown authors --
seem to have been accorded charitable status under that category nonetheless,
mainly because they did not fall within any of the other categories.  I would
agree with that caution.  To my mind, the threshold criterion for an educational
activity must be some legitimate, targeted attempt at educating others, whether
through formal or informal instruction, training, plans of self-study, or
otherwise.  Simply providing an opportunity for people to educate themselves,
such as by making available materials with which this might be accomplished but
need not be, is not enough.  Neither is “educating” people about a particular
point of view in a manner that might more aptly be described as persuasion or
indoctrination.  On the other hand, formal or traditional classroom instruction
should not be a prerequisite, either.  The point to be emphasized is that, in
appropriate circumstances, an informal workshop or seminar on a certain
practical topic or skill can be just as informative and educational as a course
of classroom instruction in a traditional academic subject.  The law ought to
accommodate any legitimate form of education.  172                       
A further concern is  that once we allow education to be directed toward
a practical end and not just the “formal training of the mind” or the
“improvement of a useful branch of human knowledge”, at some point education
ceases to be an end in itself and is better characterized as an activity
directed toward an end that must be independently determined to be charitable.
However, education is unique in that  it can be characterized both as an
activity in furtherance of some specific end and as  an  activity that provides
transferable skills and knowledge that enable one  to continue to learn new
things throughout one’s life. In this way, education is an end in itself even
when it also has an instrumental character. There may be situations in which
education cannot be said to have this dual aspect, and so ceases to be an end
in itself, but such situations are likely rare and certainly do not include the
case at bar.  173                       
In summary, then, I reiterate my view that purpose (a), the primary
purpose of the Society, would not qualify as charitable under the traditional
approach to education, as it seems to lack the element of systematic
instruction that is required by the existing Canadian jurisprudence in this
area.  However, given the commitment “to provide educational forums, classes,
workshops and seminars” to enable the Society’s constituents  “to find or
obtain employment”, it would be charitable under the more expansive definition
of education I have proposed.  That is, the purpose is to train the minds of
immigrant women in certain important life skills, with a specific end in mind:
equipping them to find and secure employment in Canada.  I find that this is
indeed a valid charitable purpose.  Moreover, certain activities carried out in
furtherance of this purpose, such as the provision of the educational programs
contemplated by the purposes clause, are undoubtedly charitable within this
expanded definition, whether or not they have the quality of systematic
instruction traditionally associated with education in the charitable sense.  174                       
Even if the purpose is charitable under the second head of the Pemsel
classification, it must still satisfy the requirement that it benefit “the
community or . . . an appreciably important class of the community”. This
requirement, in the context of education, has been held to mean that the class
must be substantial, or at least not so small that there is no benefit to the
community as a whole, and the benefits cannot be provided exclusively to a
particular class of private individuals, defined only by their personal
relationships to the organization or their creed: Oppenheim v. Tobacco
Securities Trust Co., [1951] A.C. 297 (H.L.); see also Tudor on
Charities (8th ed. 1995), at pp. 60-62. I must say that there is no doubt
in my mind that the fact that the class of beneficiaries is limited to
immigrant and visible minority women would pose no problem to the Society’s
application.  (2)     Fourth Head of Charity: Public Benefit  175                       
In Native Communications Society, supra, at pp. 479-80,
the Federal Court of Appeal set out certain “necessary preliminaries” for the
determination of a charitable purpose under the fourth category of Lord
Macnaghten’s formulation.  As Stone J.A. put it, the purpose must be beneficial
to the community “in a way which the law regards as charitable” by coming
within the “spirit and intendment” of the preamble to the Statute of
Elizabeth if not within its letter, and whether a purpose would or may
operate for the public benefit is to be answered by the court on the basis of
the record before it and in exercise of its equitable jurisdiction in matters
of charity.  176                       
In other words, more is required than simple “public benefit”, in the
ordinary sense of that term, to bring a purpose within the fourth head of Pemsel. 
In Positive Action Against Pornography, supra, at p. 352, Stone
J.A. stressed that the task of the court under this heading is relatively
narrow; it is not called upon “to decide what is beneficial to the community in
a loose sense, but only what is beneficial in a way the law regards as
charitable” (emphasis added). Thus, it is not sufficient to assert, as the
Society has, that, by helping immigrant and visible minority women to obtain
employment, it creates a “level playing field”, which is in the public benefit
because it is “in the public interest of immigrants and in fact of all Canadians
that immigrants obtain employment as quickly as possible”.  Rather than laying
claim to public benefit only in a loose or popular sense, it is incumbent upon
the Society to explain just how its purposes are beneficial in a way the law
regards as charitable.  177                       
In D’Aguiar, supra, it was recognized that the guidance
provided by the common law in this area is not particularly clear.  I agree. 
The requirement that the purposes benefit the community “in a way the law
regards as charitable” is obviously circular, and the various examples
enumerated in the preamble to the Statute of Elizabeth seem to lack a
common character or thread on which to base any coherent argument from
analogy.  That notwithstanding, however, the Privy Council in that case set out
what is in my view a useful approach to the assessment of an organization’s
purposes under the fourth head (at p. 33):  [The Court] must first consider the trend of those decisions which have
established certain objects as charitable under this heading, and ask whether,
by reasonable extension or analogy, the instant case may be considered to be in
line with these.  Secondly, it must examine certain accepted anomalies to see
whether they fairly cover the objects under consideration.  Thirdly -- and this
is really a cross-check upon the others -- it must ask whether, consistently
with the objects declared, the income and property in question can be applied
for purposes clearly falling outside the scope of charity; if so, the argument
for charity must fail.   To this I
would add the general requirement, outlined in Verge v. Somerville, supra,
at p. 499, that the purpose must also be “for the benefit of the community or
of an appreciably important class of the community” rather than for private
advantage.  178                       
In considering these requirements, then, it is first necessary to
determine what “trend”, if any, can be discerned from previous decisions under
the fourth head. My colleague, Gonthier J., reasons, at para. 95,  that there
is a line of cases  recognizing that “immigrants are often in special need of
assistance in their efforts to integrate into their new home”.  Helping immigrant
women obtain employment would therefore be included within this purpose. With
respect, I disagree that the cases cited in support of this proposition can be
so characterized.  179                       
In differing with my colleague on these cases, I do not wish to be taken
as disagreeing with the underlying sentiment that assistance to immigrant women
is a laudable goal. The question before this Court, however, is not whether
this purpose should be considered charitable but whether the common law
recognizes it to be charitable. I agree that the law in this area is in need of
reform but there are limits to the degree of change that the common law can
accommodate. It is one thing to change the law by legislative amendment and
quite another to alter the existing jurisprudence by a fundamental turning in
direction.  180                       
It is imperative to recall also the various ways in which one may
presently obtain immigrant status. There are many categories of admission under
the Immigration Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. I-2. Of particular relevance to
the present case is the category for those who seek to immigrate under the
points system, sometimes colloquially referred to as the “independent class”.
D. B. N. Bagambiire, in his text Canadian Immigration and Refugee Law
(1996), at p. 35, lists the following individuals under this categorization:  ...applicants who wish to immigrate purely on the basis of their
education, training, experience and skills possessed, known as “skilled
workers”; applicants who seek to immigrate under the business immigration
program and sub-programs; the self-employed persons, entrepreneurs and
investors; and those immigrants who are related to Canadian citizens and
permanent residents, but whose relationship with those relatives is not close
enough for them to qualify as members of the coveted and preferred family class
category, generically known as “assisted relatives”. Applicants under each one
of these subcategories are evaluated and assessed on the basis of criteria set
forth in the regulations.   What this
means is that these applicants must be assessed according to a point system
outlined in the regulations: Immigration Regulations, 1978, SOR/78-172,
ss. 6.11 to 6.19 and 8 to 11.1; see also s. 6(8) and 9(1.4) of the Immigration
Act. The central question in this assessment is whether the applicant will
be able to integrate successfully into Canadian society, with particular
emphasis placed upon employment skills and opportunities. Given this
expectation of successful integration and despite its unquestionable worthiness
as a social goal – indeed, not only for immigrants but also for all Canadians –
I fail to see how providing assistance with integration to independent
immigrants  is to be considered charitable at common law.  Of course, many
other groups of immigrants may in fact be in special need of such assistance.
But in so far as an organization assists all immigrants,  I find it
difficult to see how such an organization does not run afoul of the exclusive
charitability rule, absent either specific legislation or the targetting by the
organization of groups with special needs relating to their immigrant status.
In my opinion the case law from other jurisdictions, cited by Gonthier J.,
supports this position rather than undermines it.  181                       
In Re Stone (1970), 91 W.N. (N.S.W.) 704, the Supreme Court of
New South Wales held that the promotion of Jewish settlement in Israel was
charitable under the fourth head of charity. In finding the trust charitable
under this head, Helsham J.  referred to the case of Verge v. Somerville,
supra, which held that a trust to help resettle ex-servicemen in their
native land  and give them a “fresh start” was for a charitable purpose. He
does not discuss why  the resettlement of soldiers is analogous to Jewish
settlement in Israel, but I find the context for this analogy to be provided by
Helsham J.’s earlier discussion of the argument that this was also a trust for
the advancement of religion. Although Helsham J. rejected this argument,
following a previous House of Lords decision, he did discuss at length the
religious duty of the Jewish people to return to the Promised Land. To my mind,
it is this aspect of return, combined with the persecution of the Jewish people
that culminated in the establishment of the State of Israel, that makes this
trust analogous to that in Verge v. Somerville, supra. However, I
do not think that the analogy embraces the more general case of helping any
immigrants to settle in a new land. Immigrants, considered generally, are not
returning either to their native country or their spiritual home. Nor have they
necessarily been subjected to the hardships of soldiers or the persecution of
members of the Jewish faith. I note that Helsham J. does make a broader claim,
at p.  718, referring to  “the encouragement and settlement of migrants”. 
However, I am struck by the lack of reasoning to support this statement, and
would therefore confine the decision to the context of Jewish settlement in
Israel.  182                       
Another case cited by my colleague is In re Wallace, [1908]
V.L.R. 636 (S.C.), in which a trust to aid immigrants was upheld as a trust for
the relief of poverty. The case was clearly decided on this basis and although
Hood J. commented in obiter that, given the fact of the Immigration
Acts, a trust to aid immigration could be charitable as for the public
benefit, he also noted, at p. 640, that “there are divergent opinions on the
subject”. This latter position, involving looking to the fact of legislation as
evidence of public benefit,  invokes an understanding of public benefit that is
wider than, and contrary to, the common law of charities. The common law
determines public benefit under the fourth head through analogy to cases
already found to be charitable. I would therefore decline to follow Hood J.’s
reasoning on this point.  183                       
I do not wish to be taken as saying that the existence of legislation in
a field is never relevant to the question of what is charitable. Indeed,
the Federal Court of Appeal in Everywoman’s Health Centre Society (1988) v.
M.N.R., [1992] 2 F.C. 52,  pointed to legislation in order to rebut the
argument that the provision of abortions in private clinics was contrary to
public policy. But this is simply to say that a finding of public benefit,
understood broadly,  is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a finding
of charity under the fourth head; if there is no public benefit, then there is
no charity. Public benefit alone, however, does not equal charity.  184                       
I would also distinguish the case at bar from  In re Cohen, [1954]
N.Z.L.R. 1097 (S.C.). There the court found that a trust for the assistance of
refugees was charitable under both the first and fourth heads. It held, at p.
1101, that “the establishment in a new country of persons uprooted from and
compelled to flee their own homes” was analogous to the repatriation of
returned soldiers at issue in Verge v. Somerville, supra. The
relief of refugees was also upheld as charitable in Re Morrison (1967),
111 Sol. Jo. 758, 117 New L.J. 757 (Ch. D.). While it is true that refugees and
immigrants may share many interests and needs, it is the fact that refugees are
“compelled to flee their own homes” in the face of persecution that makes their
situation analogous to that of soldiers returning from war.  185                       
I would similarly distinguish the Ethnic Minority Training and
Employment Project, Reg. No. 1050917, registered by the Charity Commissioners
for England and Wales in  November 22, 1995, from the case at bar. The purposes
of that organization are to assist and educate  refugees, asylum seekers, migrants and others who recently arrived in
the United Kingdom, in particular those from the Horn of Africa, who through
their social and economic circumstances are in need and unable to further their
education or gain employment, and who may be at risk or [sic] permanent
exclusion from the labour market;   Refugees and
asylum seekers are distinguishable from immigrants generally, for the reasons
outlined above. Nonetheless, this organization also aids “migrants and others”.
However, it strongly qualifies this through reference to those from the Horn of
Africa and those whose circumstances are such that they face “permanent
exclusion from the labour market”. To my mind, these factors go to the relief
of poverty. Indeed, in Re Central Employment Bureau for Women and Students’
Careers Association Inc., [1942] 1 All E.R. 232 (Ch. D.), at p. 233, 
Simonds J. held that  [i]t is clear from the cases which have been cited to me that a gift
may be a good charitable gift, as in relief of poverty, although the recipients
of the gift are not in destitution, or even on the borderline of destitution.
“Poverty,” it has been said, is a relative term. I think here that the
implication of the gift to enable the recipients to become self-supporting is a
sufficient indication that they stand on the poverty side of the borderline --
that is to say, that they are persons who could not be self-supporting, in
whatever enterprise they embarked, without the assistance of this fund.
[Emphasis added.]   In the present
case, it is not clear that the Society is targeting those who are at risk of
permanent exclusion from the job market, or who cannot become self-supporting
without the Society’s assistance.  186                       
The final authority cited by my colleague is a ruling of the Internal
Revenue Service in the United States that a non-profit organization that
assists immigrants “in overcoming social, cultural and economic problems by
either personal counselling or referral to the appropriate public or private
agencies” is charitable: U.S. Rev. Rul. 76-205 in  Internal Revenue Cumulative
Bulletin 1976-1, at p. 154. The revenue ruling held that:  The organization was formed to aid immigrants to
the United States in overcoming social, cultural, and economic problems by
either personal counseling or referral to the appropriate public or private
agencies. The organization has found that immigrants may be subject to
discrimination and prejudice, often arrive without friends or relatives,
possess a limited knowledge of English, and lack an awareness of employment
opportunities. To help overcome these handicaps, the organization offers
instruction in English by its multilingual staff, job counseling, and social
and recreational functions that permit a mingling of immigrants with each other
and with United States citizens. The organization also distributes a newsletter
containing information on becoming a citizen, securing decent housing, and
obtaining medical care.  The organization relies upon grants and
contributions from the general public for support. It does not charge for its
services.  Section 501(c)(3) of the Code provides for the
exemption from Federal income tax of organizations organized and operated
exclusively for charitable and educational purposes.  Section 1.501(c)(3)-1(d)(3) of the Income Tax
Regulations defines the term “educational” as including the instruction of the
public on subjects useful to the individual and beneficial to the community.  Section 1.501(c)(3)-1(d)(2) of the regulations
provides that the term “charitable,” as used in section 501(c)(3) of the Code,
includes the elimination of prejudice and discrimination.  By counseling immigrants, the organization is
instructing the public on subjects useful to the individual and beneficial to
the community, and is, therefore, furthering an educational purpose. Personal
counseling has been recognized as a valid method of instruction for educational
organizations. See Rev. Rul. 73-569, 1973-2 C.B. 178. In addition, by offering
instruction in English, by assisting immigrants in finding helpful agencies, by
aiding immigrants to attain full citizenship, and by providing opportunities
for immigrants to meet and discuss problems with each other and United States
citizens, the organization is also eliminating prejudice and discrimination.  The activities
that the organization engages in beyond education  were therefore clearly held
to be charitable because they eliminate  prejudice and not because they are
aimed at the more general purpose of helping immigrants integrate into society.  187                       
I have difficulty agreeing that the activities described in the above
revenue ruling are directly in furtherance of the purpose of eliminating
prejudice and discrimination so as to make them exclusively charitable. Even if
they are, I have difficulty in accepting the same with respect to the case at
bar.  The Society is solely aimed at helping immigrant women obtain employment,
and it is not clear that all of the difficulties faced by immigrant
women in obtaining employment stem from prejudice and discrimination so as to
make this an exclusively charitable purpose.  For example, making contacts and
obtaining information pose difficulties with respect to gaining employment, but
these difficulties do not necessarily indicate prejudice and discrimination.
Therefore the Society’s objects fail the third step of the D’Aguiar
approach to the fourth head of charity, which asks whether “consistently with
the objects declared, the income and property in question can be applied for
purposes clearly falling outside the scope of charity” (p. 33). As the matter
is not in issue, I would also decline to comment as to whether the elimination
of prejudice and discrimination may be recognized as a charitable purpose at
common law.  188                       
The only Canadian authority provided to me is Re Fitzgibbon
(1916), 27 O.W.R. 207 (H.C.), in which a bequest to an institution for the
assistance of immigrant girls was upheld. With respect, I do not find the
reasoning in this case persuasive. Middleton J. did not follow the Pemsel
approach endorsed by this Court and, moreover, drew analogies to cases that
appear to have an educational component and so provide little assistance in
determining the content of the fourth head of charity.  189                       
In summary, I do not find any support for the proposition that assisting
immigrant women to integrate into society through helping them to obtain
employment is a charitable purpose under the fourth head of charity. Therefore
I would characterize  purpose (a) listed in the Society’s purposes solely in
terms of education. That, however, does not end the inquiry.  For one thing, it
remains to be determined whether all of the Society’s resources are devoted to
activities in furtherance of charitable purposes.  But, before I turn to answer
that question, the Society must overcome another preliminary hurdle and that is
the examination of its listed purposes (b), (c), and (e).  In Guaranty Trust,
supra, this Court confirmed the rather obvious proposition that, even if
one or more of an organization’s purposes are charitable, the organization still
cannot be considered charitable if its other purposes cannot qualify as such. 
That is, a valid charitable organization must be constituted exclusively
for charitable purposes. For reasons that I will outline, I believe  that if 
purposes (b), (c), and (e) are to be upheld, they must be found to be ancillary
and incidental to the valid educational purpose found in purpose (a).  (3) Ancillary and Incidental Purposes  190                       
Purposes (b) and (c) contemplate carrying out political activities and
soliciting funds from public and private sources.  Political purposes are not
generally considered charitable (see, for example, Positive Action Against
Pornography, supra), and certain exceptions available under s. 149.1 
of the ITA , which I will discuss below, apply only to political
activities incidental and ancillary to other, charitable activities, not
political purposes incidental and ancillary to other, charitable
purposes: Human Life International, supra.  191                       
Thus, it is significant to note that  paragraphs (b) and (c) of the
Society’s purposes clause make it  quite clear that the activities to be
carried out in furtherance of those purposes are to be “ancillary and indental”
to purpose (a), which I have found to be a valid educational purpose.  I
believe that the inclusion of this language was actually an attempt to bring
the Society into conformity with the exception in s. 149.1(6.2)  of the ITA ,
which provides that, to the extent that political activities carried out by an
organization are “incidental and ancillary” to charitable activities, the
portion of the organization’s resources that is devoted to the political
activities is deemed to be devoted to charitable activities.  192                       
As I have already indicated, s. 149.1(6.2)  makes no mention of political
purposes and thus provides no direct assistance to the Society. 
However, the indirect result of the Society’s effort to comply with the section
is that its purposes clause now makes clear that the sole purpose of carrying
out political activities and raising funds is to facilitate a valid educational
purpose.  Thus, in my view, purposes (b) and (c) can be taken as means to the
fulfilment of purpose (a), not ends in themselves, and thus do not disqualify
the Society from obtaining registration as a charity under the ITA .  193                       
Purpose (e), on the other hand, poses a more serious problem.  Because
of its extremely broad drafting, which mandates the Society to do “all such
things that are incidental or conducive to the attainment of” its other
purposes, it is difficult to discern whether it is a means of fulfilment or an
end in itself.  That is, while doing things that are “incidental” to the
attainment of charitable purposes might safely be  treated as a means of
fulfilment of the purposes, the same cannot be said of doing things that are
merely “conducive” to those ends.  To say that an action is “conducive” to a
result implies only that the action leads or contributes to the result, not
that it is carried on only in pursuit thereof.  In other words, one purpose may
be conducive to another while still remaining an end in itself, not merely a
means to the fulfilment of the second purpose.  This, combined with the
exceedingly vague content of purpose (e), leads me to conclude that it cannot
be classified as charitable simply on the basis of its relationship to the
educational purpose disclosed in purpose (a).  194                       
But the inquiry cannot stop there.  In Guaranty Trust, supra,
at p. 144, this Court expressed the view that the question of whether an
organization was constituted exclusively for charitable purposes cannot be
determined solely by reference to the objects and purposes for which it was
originally established.  It is also necessary to consider the nature of the
activities presently carried on by the organization as a potential indicator of
whether it has since adopted other purposes.  In other words, as Lord Denning
put it in Institution of Mechanical Engineers v. Cane, [1961]
A.C. 696 (H.L.), at p. 723, the real question is, “for what purposes is the
society at present instituted?” (Emphasis in original.)  195                       
Thus, even if I have given too restrictive or literal a reading to
purpose (e) of the Society, I draw further support for my conclusion as to its
non-charitable character from the nature of the activities carried out by the
Society.  For example, I do not see how the provision of a job skills directory
and the establishment of support groups for professionals constitute
educational activities, nor do they appear to me to be “incidental” to the
attainment of purpose (a) of the Society. Hence, unless they are carried out in
contravention of the purposes clause, they must fall under purpose (e) as
activities “conducive” to the other purposes.  However, while these may well be
useful services, they are directly in furtherance of helping immigrant women to
find employment, which in itself is not a charitable purpose.  This proves that
the purposes of the Society can and do accommodate non-charitable activities. 
They are simply too vague and indeterminate to permit the Society to qualify
for charitable status under the fourth head of Pemsel.  C.   A New
Approach?  196                       
A finding that the Society does not satisfy the traditional requirements
of charity does not exhaust its arguments.  In fact, it reserved perhaps its
most forceful submissions to urge this Court to consider adopting an entirely
new approach to the definition of “charitable”.  Citing reports by law reform
commissions in England and Australia, the Society observed that the law of
charities has historically been difficult to define and even more difficult to reform. 
These commissions have typically found that the traditional definition reflects
a narrow and outdated view of the type of activities which should be encouraged
and protected by the law, that it provides little guidance to the ordinary
citizen, and that it is reactive and unable to respond to changing societal
needs.  However, their various attempts to devise either a new definition or
alternative, acceptable categories have been unsuccessful.  197                       
Accordingly, the Society has submitted that a new, “contextual” approach
to charity should be adopted.  Such an approach, it is suggested, would respect
the precedents developed in the jurisprudence, but not to the exclusion of
finding new activities to be charitable.  This new approach, which would be
triggered only upon an organization’s failing to meet the traditional
requirements, would be to ask whether the organization is performing a “public
benefit”.  There would  be no fixed definition or categories of public
benefit.  Instead, the court would consider a series of questions in making the
determination, including whether the activities of the organization are
consistent with constitutional and Charter  values, whether the
activities complement the legislative goals enunciated by elected representatives,
and whether they are of a type in respect of which government spending is
typically allocated. It is further suggested that such factors as vagueness and
uncertainty could negate a finding of charity, but that vagueness alone would
not be an automatic bar to classification as charitable because “many
activities that we consider charitable are by their very nature vague and
uncertain”.  198                       
The Society, in support of this approach, relies upon certain passages
from the decisions of the Federal Court of Appeal in Native Communications
Society, supra, and  Everywoman’s Health Centre Society, supra. 
At the outset, I must note that, while I am not unsympathetic to the argument
that a new approach to the definition of charity would be welcome, my reading of
these cases discloses nothing that could be taken to support the suggested
approach.  Indeed, I must say that I find the suggestion that the Federal Court
of Appeal erred in law by failing to apply what amounts to an entirely novel
doctrine to be quite surprising.  199                       
That aside, I also see a number of serious flaws in the approach
proposed by the Society.  To begin with, the Society appears to confuse the
concept of charitable purposes with that of charitable activities.  As I
have already noted, any definition of charity must be concerned primarily with
the former, not the latter, as the true issue is whether activities are carried
on in furtherance of a charitable purpose or purposes.  Activities which may on
first glance appear to be non-charitable or ambiguous may take on an entirely
different character when carried on in furtherance of a purpose which is
clearly charitable.  200                       
Even more importantly, though, the new approach would constitute a
radical change to the common law and, consequently, to tax law.  In my view,
the fact that the ITA  does not define “charitable”, leaving it instead
to the tests enunciated by the common law, indicates the desire of Parliament
to limit the class of charitable organizations to the relatively restrictive
categories available under Pemsel and the subsequent case law.  This can
be seen as reflecting the preferred tax policy: given the tremendous tax
advantages available to charitable organizations, and the consequent loss of
revenue to the public treasury, it is not unreasonable to limit the number of
taxpayers who are entitled to this status.  For this Court suddenly to adopt a
new and more expansive definition of charity, without warning, could have a
substantial and serious effect on the taxation system.  In my view, especially
in light of the prominent role played by legislative priorities in the “new
approach”, this would be a change better effected by Parliament than by the
courts.  201                       
Still, it is difficult to dispute that the law of charity has been
plagued by a lack of coherent principles on which consistent judgment may be
founded.  The Statute of Elizabeth was never intended to provide an
exhaustive list of charitable purposes, and although the categories enunciated
by Lord Macnaghten in Pemsel are to some extent a useful classification
of what the common law has decided is charitable, they should not and have not
been read strictly by the courts.  Again, the law of charity has always been
treated as a “moving subject”: Scottish Burial Reform, supra, at
p. 154.  But if this is to remain the case, very little assistance is provided
by such standards as “in a way which the law regards as charitable” and “within
the spirit and intendment of the preamble to the Statute of Elizabeth”, given
their circular reasoning and retrospective bias.   In the submission of the
intervener, the Canadian Centre for Philanthropy (the “Centre”), “without
having available a method which allows for consideration of the underlying
elements of charitable purpose, any movement forward may be frustrated”.  202                       
As I have said, it would not be appropriate for the Court, in the
context of this case, to adopt an entirely new definition of charity.  If this
is to be done, especially for the purposes of the ITA , the specifics of
the desired approach will be for Parliament to decide.  Although it is not
necessary for me to comment on proposals for change, particularly since aspects
of the Centre’s proposals may themselves need further clarifications and
refinements, I would commend for serious consideration the general framework
suggested by the Centre as potentially a useful guide for the legislator.
Consistent both with the conceptual approach taken by the Ontario Law Reform
Commission (albeit not with its ultimate recommendations, which advise against
a legislated definition of charity) and with D’Aguiar, supra, and
drawing heavily from G. H. L. Fridman’s article, “Charities and Public Benefit”
(1953), 31 Can. Bar Rev. 537, at pp. 551-52, the Centre proposes an approach
which focuses on whether a given project pursues a good for the benefit of
strangers in a way that is practically useful.  A three-step inquiry is
suggested, as follows:  (1)    Determine whether the purposes are
charitable within the first three heads of Pemsel: the relief of
poverty, the advancement of religion, or the advancement of education.  (2)    If not, determine whether a public benefit
is offered, by examining whether  (a)       the purpose benefits an identifiable
group of people, of whatever size, having a common interest;  (b)       the benefit is physical or spiritual,
measurable or intangible, direct or indirect; and  (c)       the benefit is reasonably recognized and
realistically to be provided, as opposed to merely speculative, putative, or
hoped-for.  If these requirements are met, then a prima facie presumption of
charitable purpose is raised.  If not, then proceed to determine whether the
purpose falls within one of the decided anomalies under the fourth head of Pemsel.  (3)    Once a prima facie presumption of
charity is established, determine whether there are grounds for holding the
purpose to be non-charitable by reason of one or more of the following:  (a)       exceptions previously decided (e.g.,
political purpose or purpose contrary to public policy);  (b)       reasons of public policy relating to the
nature of the common interest; or  (c)       a failure to be exclusively charitable
because the means or activities undertaken are not primarily concerned with
giving actual effect to the stated purpose or, at least, subordinate to the
primary concern.   203                       
As a general matter, there is much to be said for this approach, which
focuses primarily on the purposes and not the activities of a given
organization and respects both the established law of charity and the need for
a flexible approach that will permit movement forward.  Certainly, it poses a
viable solution to the interpretive problems now inherent in the law, which is
preferable not only to the Society’s proposal but also to the suggestion that
the Court simply add another category to the categories established by Pemsel,
a suggestion which, in my view, would do little to enhance the fairness or
flexibility of the law.  However, I reiterate that, even though some
substantial change in the law of charity would be desirable and welcome at this
time, any such change must be left to Parliament.  To be sure, the proposed
change would amount to much more than merely a clarification of the law;
indeed, it would likely result in a major expansion of the range of
organizations that can qualify as charitable both under the ITA  and
otherwise.   This would go well beyond the type of incremental change to the
common law which this Court has been prepared to make.  D.  Are 
All of the Organization’s Resources Devoted to Charitable Activities or
Does      the Organization Falls Within the Specific Exemptions of Section
149.1(6.1)  or          (6.2) ?  204                       
It will be clear from the foregoing that I am of the view that the
purposes of the Society do not restrict it to charitable activities, and thus
that the Society cannot be viewed as being constituted exclusively for
charitable purposes.  As such, it is unnecessary for me to decide whether all
of the organization’s resources are devoted to charitable activities or
whether  the organization falls within the specific exemptions of s. 149.1(6.1) 
or (6.2) . That is, its application for registration as a charitable
organization would have been properly rejected by Revenue Canada even on the
basis of its purposes clause alone.  However, given the great deal of argument
focused on the activities actually carried out by the Society, and despite the
inevitable overlap between the discussions of purposes and activities, a few
brief remarks about the nature of the Society’s activities are, I believe,
appropriate at this point.  205                       
Even if I were to assume that all of the Society’s stated purposes are
charitable, it is clear that several of the activities detailed in its
submissions to Revenue Canada, including the aforementioned job skills
directory as well as networking, liaising for accreditation of credentials,
soliciting job opportunities, and offering referral services, are not. These
activities  cannot be said to be carried on in furtherance of, or incidental or
ancillary to, any valid charitable purpose. That is, teaching women skills they
require to obtain employment in Canada is one thing; publishing a directory and
otherwise marketing those skills to prospective employers is quite another. 
While these additional services are no doubt helpful to the members of the
Society as well as, presumably, to their eventual employers, the Society has
failed to show how they fall within any of the established categories of
charity, either directly or by analogy.  Thus, it is impossible, in my view, to
say either that the Society’s activities are actually restricted to charitable activities
or that substantially all of its resources are allocated to such activities. 
In fact, the opposite conclusion is indicated.  206                       
In the result, I am of the view that the Society has not satisfied
either of the two criteria for registration as a charity under s. 248(1)  of the
ITA .  In this respect, while I differ somewhat in the reasoning
involved, I am in substantial agreement with the ultimate conclusion reached by
both Revenue Canada and the Federal Court of Appeal.  E.  Charter
Considerations  207                       
One final submission merits some consideration.  It was argued by the
interveners, the Minority Advocacy and Rights Council, the Canadian
Ethnocultural Council, and the Centre for Research Action on Race Relations
that the rule in Pemsel, as incorporated in ss. 248(1)  and 149.1(1)  of
the ITA , violates s. 15  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms  by discriminating against immigrant and visible minority women on
the basis of the analogous ground of immigrant status as well as the enumerated
grounds of race, gender, and national or ethnic origin.  Very briefly, the
argument runs as follows.  The purpose of the Pemsel rule is to support
socially desirable activities of registered charities for the benefit of their
beneficiaries by facilitating the raising of revenue to fund these activities. 
Denying the Society registration under the aforementioned subsections of the ITA 
may result in its being able to raise less revenue, which means that immigrant
and visible minority women may not enjoy the full range of activities that
otherwise might be available to them.  The result, it is submitted, is that
these women are denied benefits made available to others by virtue of
“irrelevant personal characteristics”.  208                       
With respect, because I see no merit to this argument, it can be dealt
with briefly.  The interplay of Pemsel and the ITA  results in a
scheme whereby any organization, by restricting itself to charitable purposes
and activities, can qualify for registration as a charitable organization. 
This proposition also holds in its inverse form: every organization, to qualify
for registration under s. 248(1) , must restrict itself to charitable purposes
and activities.  This requirement applies uniformly to every organization that
seeks to be registered as charitable.  The rejection of the Society’s
application for registration was a consequence of the nature of its purposes
and activities, not of the characteristics of its intended beneficiaries.  In
fact, as I have already stated, the personal characteristics of the class of
beneficiaries would erect no barrier to the Society’s application if it could
show that its purposes and activities were otherwise charitable.  Simply put,
nothing in the law operates to prevent immigrant and visible minority women
from forming the beneficiary class of a properly constituted charitable
organization.  The denial of registration in this case has been the result not
of any discrimination within the meaning of s. 15, but of the organization’s
inability to bring itself within established guidelines of uniform application.  209                       
Thus, I must reject the suggestion that the operation of the charitable
registration scheme in the ITA  constitutes a violation of the s. 15 
rights of the Society’s intended beneficiaries.  VI.  Disposition  210
