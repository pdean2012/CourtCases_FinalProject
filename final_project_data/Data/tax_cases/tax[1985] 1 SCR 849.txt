Le Dain JJ.   on appeal from the court of appeal for quebec   Statutes and Regulations Cited                        APPEAL from a judgment of the Quebec Court of
Appeal, sub nom. Re St. Louis Textiles Limited; Minister of National
Revenue v. Blais (1983), 48 C.B.R. (N.S.) 98, allowing the appeal from a
judgment of the Superior Court. Appeal dismissed.                     Allan R. Hilton,
for the appellant.                     Claude Joyal
and Gaspard Côté, Q.C., for the respondent.                     The following is the judgment delivered by   2.                The Court of Appeal found the company
had no obligation under s. 27(1)  of the Excise Tax Act  since it had not
sold the goods to an unlicensed purchaser, nor retained them for its own use or
rental to others, prior to becoming bankrupt. Accordingly, the tax was not a
claim provable in bankruptcy under the Bankruptcy Act. The court
concluded that the appellant was liable to pay tax under s. 27(3)  of the Excise
Tax Act  upon his sale of the goods, and that he could deduct the amount so
paid from the proceeds of sale as an expense of administration.  3.                We adopt the reasons of the Court of
Appeal for Quebec and dismiss this appeal with costs.                     Appeal dismissed with costs.                     Solicitors for the appellant: Clarkson, Tétrault, Montréal.                     Solicitors for the respondent: Côté, Ouellet & Demers, Montréal.
